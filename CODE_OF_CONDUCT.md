# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be cool. Treat others how you'd want to be treated. We're all here because we're nerds about credit card points — let's keep it fun.

## The Longer Version

### Our Standards

**Do:**
- Be respectful and constructive
- Welcome newcomers warmly
- Accept feedback gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the project
- Show empathy to fellow humans

**Don't:**
- Use offensive or exclusionary language
- Troll, harass, or be condescending
- Share others' private info
- Engage in behavior that would make your mom disappointed

### Scope

This applies to all project spaces — issues, PRs, discussions, and anywhere you're representing the project.

### Enforcement

If someone's being a jerk:
1. **First**: Friendly reminder
2. **Second**: Temporary ban
3. **Third**: Permanent ban

Report issues to the maintainer. All reports will be reviewed and kept confidential.
