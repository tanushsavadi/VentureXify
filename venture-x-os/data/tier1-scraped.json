Let's discuss who should — and shouldn't — consider applying for the Venture X.\n\n## Key Capital One Venture X benefits\n\nNew Venture X applicants can earn 75,000 bonus miles after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nThose 75,000 miles are worth at least $750 when redeemed for travel through Capital One's travel booking site or as statement credits toward other travel purchases.\n\nPIOLA666/GETTY IMAGES\nHowever, according to TPG's November 2025 valuations, the bonus value is boosted to $1,388 if you transfer these miles to Capital One's 15-plus airline and hotel transfer partners instead.\n\nIn addition to the annual $300 Capital One Travel credit and the 10,000 anniversary bonus miles (starting in year one), cardholders also get plenty of other valuable benefits:\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\n\nJoin over 1,000,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts\n\n• **Authorized users:**Up to four authorized users can be added at no charge.\n• **Solid earning rates:** 10 miles per dollar spent on hotels and car rentals booked via Capital One Travel, 5 miles per dollar spent on flights and vacation rentals booked via Capital One Travel, and an unlimited 2 miles per dollar spent on all other purchases.\n• **Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit:**Up to $120 in statement credits for either TSA PreCheck or Global Entry.\n• **Lounge access:** Complimentary access for cardholders and authorized users and up to two guests per visit to Capital One Lounges. Cardholders also get access to 1,300-plus Priority Pass lounges worldwide. However, these policies will change Feb. 1, 2026. After this, authorized users will no longer receive complimentary access to Capital One lounges or Priority Pass lounges (unless they pay a $125 lounge access fee), and cardholders will no longer be allowed two complimentary guests to airport lounges (unless they spend $75,000 on the Venture X in a calendar year).\n\n**Related: The best premium credit cards: A side-by-side comparison**\n\n## Who should get the Venture X?\n\nIf you're considering the Venture X, here's when it could be a good fit.\n\nCardMatch\n\nLet us help find the best card for you\n\nGet personalized card matches to maximize your earning potential.

Thankfully, the Venture X keeps things simple.\n\nThis card offers easy-to-use benefits, including the previously mentioned $300 travel credit and 10,000 anniversary miles.\n\nSPOOH/GETTY IMAGES\nThe Venture X also serves as a great catch-all card since it earns 2 miles per dollar spent on all charges outside of hotels, rental cars, flights and vacation rentals booked via Capital One Travel.\n\n### You want to go to airport lounges\n\nVenture X cardholders have access to a growing network of Capital One Lounges, including locations at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Dulles International Airport (IAD) and Denver International Airport (DEN). There's also a Capital One Landing — which functions more like a traditional restaurant — at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA).",

    "content": "CAPITAL ONE\nCapital One Lounges all have a modern design and offer premium dining experiences, craft cocktails, wellness areas and business facilities. Food and drinks differ from lounge to lounge, often incorporating local delicacies and drinks from nearby cocktail bars.\n\n### You want free authorized users\n\nVenture X cardholders can add up to four authorized users at no cost — an excellent value proposition for a premium travel rewards card. You'll earn miles when your authorized users spend on your account, but know that you're still liable for the bill.\n\nAuthorized users also get Hertz President's Circle elite status. By registering through your Capital One account, your authorized user can enjoy top-tier status with Hertz car rentals.\n\nAuthorized users receive free airport lounge access until Feb 1, 2026. After that, it will cost $125 per authorized user.\n\n_Upon enrollment, accessible through the Capital One website or mobile app, eligible cardholders will remain at that status level through the duration of the offer. Please note, enrolling through the normal Hertz Gold Plus Rewards enrollment process (e.g., at hertz.com) will not automatically detect a cardholder as being eligible for the program and cardholders will not be automatically upgraded to the applicable status tier. Additional terms apply._\n\n### You want travel protections\n\nThis Visa Infinite card offers some of the industry's most comprehensive travel and trip protection benefits.\n\nThat includes trip cancellation and interruption insurance, trip delay reimbursement, lost luggage reimbursement, cellphone protection, primary rental car protection, purchase protection, extended warranty protection, and return protection.\n\n**Related: 5 of the most underrated travel rewards cards**\n\n## Who shouldn't get the Venture X?\n\nWhile the Venture X is an impressive product, it's not for everyone. Here's why.\n\n### You want a robust network of premium lounges right now\n\nThere are currently five open Capital One Lounges and a single Capital One Landing (a dining concept) you can get into with a Venture X card. In addition, the included Priority Pass Select membership gives you access to a variety of third-party lounges around the world.\n\nCapital One has plans to expand its lounge network, but other issuers have made significant strides in building their own expansive lounge networks. For instance, those with the American Express Platinum Card® (and its business counterpart) receive access to Amex Centurion Lounges.\n\nJORDAN WALLER/THE POINTS GUY\nAmex Platinum cardmembers also get access to the Global Lounge Collection, which includes access to Priority Pass lounges, Delta Sky Clubs (when catching a same-day Delta flight), and various other lounge networks.\n\nIf you want immediate access to a large lounge network, the Venture X may not be the best choice.\n\n### You don't travel much or plan to leverage transfer partners\n\nTo truly maximize the Venture X card, you should consider leveraging Capital One's transfer program.\n\nCapital One has made several significant advancements to its mileage program over the past few years, including shifting from fixed-rate redemptions to adding airline and hotel transfer partners and improving mileage transfer rates. Some standout transfer partners are Air France-KLM Flying Blue and Japan Airlines (JAL) Mileage Bank.\n\nIf you don't use transfer partners, the best you can do is redeem miles at a rate of 1 cent each toward any travel purchase.\n\n**Related: How (and why) you should earn transferable credit card points**\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe Venture X is an excellent option for those seeking a premium travel rewards card, especially if they frequently fly into or out of an airport with a Capital One Lounge.",

It's also a solid choice for travelers who value simplicity, from flat-rate earnings to fixed-value redemptions.\n\nThe Venture X was the first credit card I added to my wallet that charged an annual fee higher than $100, so I can vouch for it firsthand.\n\nWhile the Venture X doesn't offer multiple statement credits or elite status benefits, this card is a solid choice for travelers looking for an option that's a little less complicated. **Card rating*: ⭐⭐⭐⭐½**\n\nGet updates on special offers and compare our editors’ top credit card picks with our daily newsletter.\n\n_*Card rating is based on the opinion of TPG's editors and is not influenced by the card issuer._\n\n## Venture X: The basics\n\nIn Capital One's family of travel rewards cards, the Venture X stands at the top of the suite in terms of the perks offered and its annual fee. Here's a breakdown of the highlights.\n\n**Annual fee**: $395. This is modest compared to its counterparts from American Express and Chase — and one of the most attractive aspects of the card, in my opinion.\n\n**Recurring rewards**: Cardholders receive a $300 annual statement credit for select travel booked through Capital One Travel and 10,000 bonus miles on each account anniversary. They also receive a suite of purchase and travel protections.\n\nZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY\n**Lounge access**: Currently, the Venture X card provides access for primary cardholders to Capital One Lounges and Capital One Landing. The primary cardholder also receives a Priority Pass membership that unlocks access to 1,300-plus lounges worldwide.\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\n\nJoin over 1,000,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts\n\nHowever, Capital One's lounge access rules will become stricter starting Feb. 1, 2026.",

If you max out this credit, the effective annual fee is lowered to just $95 per year.\n\nI recommend using this perk to pay for boutique hotel stays or in areas where there are fewer options from major hotel brands, such as Hilton or Marriott. You can also apply it to car rentals and flights.\n\nMACKENZIE ROCHE/THE POINTS GUY\nIn the past, I've used this credit to shave $300 off a three-night stay at the Conrad Las Vegas at Resorts World. The stay would've cost me nearly $1,000 if I hadn't applied the credit. Since I was traveling for an expensive concert, this discount helped justify the trip.\n\nCardholders also receive 10,000 bonus miles every account anniversary. TPG's November 2025 valuations place those 10,000 miles as worth $185; they'll hit your account after your first anniversary.\n\nWhen you total these two perks, you're receiving $485 in value each year. In my view, maximizing these two benefits alone makes it incredibly easy to justify the $395 annual fee.\n\n### Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee statement credit\n\nWith the Venture X, you'll receive a statement credit of up to $120 for your TSA PreCheck or Global Entry application fee.\n\nThis is a common perk on many cards, but it doesn't have to go to waste if you're already enrolled in one of these programs. You can use the statement credit toward application fees for anyone. Just be sure you pay with your Venture X.\n\n### Lounge access\n\nThe Venture X unlocks lounge access for primary cardholders to its six opened lounges across the U.S. You can find these lounges in:",

    "content": "### Lounge access\n\nThe Venture X unlocks lounge access for primary cardholders to its six opened lounges across the U.S. You can find these lounges in:\n\n• Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)\n• Denver International Airport (DEN)\n• Dulles International Airport (IAD) near Washington, D.C.\n• Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) in Las Vegas\n• John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City\n• Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Washington, D.C.*\n\n_*Capital One Landing. Capital One is currently planning to open another Landing concept at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City in late 2025._\n\nThe Venture X has historically provided generous guest policies for its lounges, but it will tighten these rules Feb. 1, 2026. From this date forward, primary cardholders and authorized users will no longer be able to bring in guests to Capital One lounges for free unless they spend at least $75,000 on their card in a calendar year.\n\nCHRISTINE GALLIPEAU/THE POINTS GUY\nYou can add authorized users to your Venture X account at no additional charge, unless you want to add complimentary lounge access after Feb. 1, 2026. Authorized users can receive lounge access after paying $125 for each card (for up to four users).\n\nI find this change disappointing since I frequently travel with a companion and enjoyed bringing them to a Capital One Lounge when we're traveling through an airport that has one.\n\n### Travel and purchase protections\n\nThe Venture X includes a list of useful travel and purchase protections:\n\n• Auto rental collision damage waiver\n• Cellphone protection\n• Extended warranty protection\n• Return protection\n• Trip cancellation and interruption\n\nWhat I love about the Venture X's benefits is that they're valuable without being a complex list of statement credits. You don't have to make a spreadsheet or memorize when monthly or biannual perks expire.\n\nThis fact alone makes the Venture X a simpler option than premium rewards cards from other issuers. Those cards, such as the American Express Platinum Card® and the Chase Sapphire Reserve® (see rates and fees), carry useful benefits, but they do require extra planning and mindful spending to truly maximize.\n\n**Related: How I used my Venture X to get almost $800 in value from a Caribbean winter getaway**\n\n## How to earn and use Capital One miles on the Venture X\n\nIt's easy to earn, redeem and transfer the miles you earn on the Venture X.\n\n### Earning miles\n\nWith this card, you'll earn:\n\n• 10 miles per dollar spent on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel\n• 5 miles per dollar spent on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel\n• 2 miles per dollar spent on all other eligible purchases\n\nYou aren't going to find a long list of bonus categories on the Venture X, but it's a solid card to use for everyday nonbonus spending.\n\n### Redeeming miles\n\nOnce you've earned a swath of Capital One miles, you could choose simplicity for your redemptions. Capital One provides multiple fixed-value options for cardholders. However, these redemption options provide less value than TPG's valuation of Capital One miles at 1.85 cents per mile. These options are:\n\n• Book a trip through Capital One Travel\n• Capital One Entertainment\n• Cash back\n• Cover a recent travel purchase\n• Gift cards\n• Online shopping through Amazon or PayPal",

    "content": "• Book a trip through Capital One Travel\n• Capital One Entertainment\n• Cash back\n• Cover a recent travel purchase\n• Gift cards\n• Online shopping through Amazon or PayPal\n\nThe ability to cover a recent travel purchase is an exceptional feature of Capital One miles. Cardholders can use miles for travel purchases made with the Venture X in the last 90 days. These purchases include airlines, bus lines, car rental agencies, cruise lines, hotels, limousine services, rail lines, taxi cabs, timeshares and travel agents.\n\nWhen it comes to the other fixed-value redemption choices, I generally don't recommend using an option that nets you less than 1 cent per mile in value.\n\nTPG director of points, miles and credit card content Carly Helfand once used 100,000 Capital One miles to take $1,000 off a last-minute Airbnb she booked for two weeks as COVID-19 began to surge before her wedding in 2022.\n\nTPG content operations managing editor Madison Blancaflor has also used this benefit to cover Amtrak tickets to visit Boston from New York City with her mom earlier this year.\n\nZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY\nAnother fixed-value option is to book with miles through Capital One Travel. When you use this option, you can choose to book with the Lifestyle Collection or the Premier Collection. Cardholders can redeem their miles for stays at these properties and receive additional perks during their stay.\n\n### Transferring miles\n\nYou'll receive the most value for your miles when you transfer to one of Capital One's 15-plus loyalty program partners. These partners include a high-value program such as Air Canada Aeroplan and programs with large footprints such as Choice Privileges.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to redeem Capital One miles is by booking with Delta Air Lines through its SkyTeam alliance partner Air France-KLM Flying Blue. I have transferred 15,000 miles to Flying Blue to book two one-way domestic tickets on Delta.\n\nIt's worth noting that Capital One allows transfers to only one U.S. domestic airline, JetBlue TrueBlue, at a less-than-optimal 5:3 ratio. However, you can book partner flights through airline alliances, such as using Aeroplan points to book United Airlines flights.\n\nWhether you opt to go for the simple route or want to maximize your miles, you have options.\n\n**Related: Cashing in Capital One miles? How to get the maximum value when redeeming miles**\n\n## Where the Venture X could fall short\n\nWhile I have been pleased as a Venture X cardholder for over a year, I can see reasons why the card may fall short for others.\n\n### You find the Capital One Travel credit too rigid\n\nThe $300 travel credit on the Venture X is limited to bookings made through the Capital One Travel portal.\n\nIf you are vehemently opposed to using an outside travel agency (such as an issuer's portal) or find that restriction overly limiting, then you may be better off with a card that provides a more flexible annual travel credit, like that on the Sapphire Reserve.\n\n### You want higher earning rates across more bonus categories\n\nThe Venture X earns a flat 2 miles per dollar spent on most purchases. Other rewards cards feature multiple bonus categories for everything from travel to dining.\n\nCAROLINE LASCOM/THE POINTS GUY\nIf you want to earn at an elevated level for more types of purchases, spending on the Venture X may not satisfy you.\n\n### You want more extensive lounge access",

It offers similar earning rates but fewer perks for a lower $95 annual fee.\n\nThe Venture Rewards doesn't include lounge access, the $300 annual Capital One Travel credit or 10,000 bonus miles at each cardholder anniversary.\n\nPestana Royal All-Inclusive Resort in Madeira, Portugal. MADISON BLANCAFLOR/THE POINTS GUY\nBoth cards come with a statement credit toward Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and 2 miles per dollar spent on most eligible purchases.\n\nWhen you're deciding between the two, I think a key consideration is whether you'd use the Venture X's $300 annual travel credit. If you would, then it's easy to justify the Venture X's $395 annual fee compared to the $95 annual fee on the Venture Rewards.\n\n**Related: Capital One Venture Rewards vs. Capital One Venture X: Worth the extra $300?**\n\n## When to apply for the Venture X\n\nThe best time to apply for the Venture X is when the welcome bonus offers more than 75,000 miles — though we still recommend applying when the card is offering its standard bonus.\n\nNew Venture X applicants can earn 75,000 bonus miles after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY\nAccording to TPG's November 2025 valuations, this offer is worth $1,388 when you leverage Capital One's transfer partners. If you decide to redeem these miles at a fixed value, the bonus is worth up to $750.\n\nIf you decide to apply, you'll want to keep Capital One's application restrictions in mind, especially the 48-month rule between earning bonuses on a card within the Venture family. However, these restrictions shouldn't impact your ability to be approved for the Venture X unless you've had the card and earned the bonus on it within the last 48 months.\n\n**Related: Are you eligible for the Capital One Venture X welcome bonus?**\n\n## Other cards to consider instead of the Venture X\n\nI've discussed how the Venture X relates to its competitors throughout the review, but here's a card-by-card breakdown of what you could consider if you want a rewards card like the Venture X but with a few key differences.",

Plus, the card can provide incredibly high value if you're organized enough to maximize each of its many statement credits. Enrollment is required for select benefits.

I keep it in my wallet because of its fantastic ongoing value, which more than offsets its annual fee, in my opinion.\n\nWhen you consider how the premium card market has continued to raise annual fees and add statement credits, the Venture X has remained simple and maintained its usefulness.\n\nI'd recommend this card to travelers who value simplicity and want to collect valuable Capital One miles.

We don’t cover all available credit cards, but our analysis, reviews, and opinions are entirely from our editorial team. Terms apply to the offers listed on this page. Please view our advertising policy and product review methodology for more information.\n\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup is one of the most anticipated sporting events of the decade, with unprecedented demand expected as the tournament comes to North America for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nThat demand makes tickets especially hard to lock down. Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card holders, however, will soon get a special opportunity to purchase tickets without going through FIFA's general lottery system — a perk that could make the difference between watching from home and securing a seat in the stands.\n\nIf you're a Venture X cardholder and attending the World Cup is on your bucket list, here's what you need to know.\n\n## Capital One Venture X World Cup ticket sale details\n\nFrom Feb. 12 through Feb. 24, eligible Capital One Venture X cardholders will have access to a dedicated ticket sale for select 2026 FIFA World Cup matches across U.S. host cities. Tickets will be available on a first-come, first-served basis while supplies last.

Let's get started.\n\nHow do you want to redeem your rewards?\n\nBooking travel and travel experiences\n\nCash back and statement credits\n\nTake me to CardMatch\n\n## Is the Venture X worth it for ticket access?\n\nWhile this ticket sale alone may not justify applying for a new credit card, it could be a compelling added perk for anyone already considering the Capital One Venture X. The card carries a premium annual fee of $395, but it also comes with plenty of perks, including a $300 annual travel credit, airport lounge access and strong earning rates on travel purchases. For those reasons, the Venture X is one of the most used cards in my wallet.\n\nFor more details, check out our full review of the Capital One Venture X.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nWorld Cup tickets are notoriously difficult to score, especially for U.S. matches. Venture X cardholders will get a short but valuable head start from Feb. 12 to Feb. 24, with the ability to purchase up to four tickets before FIFA's general sale goes live.\n\nIf you're hoping to attend the 2026 tournament, this exclusive sale could make all the difference.\n\n**Related: Why the Capital One Venture X could be the best option for your first premium card**\n\nFeatured image by SANDRA MONTANEZ/GETTY IMAGES\n\nEditorial disclaimer: Opinions expressed here are the author’s alone, not those of any bank, credit card issuer, airline or hotel chain, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities.\n\n## Check out current card offers\n\n• Learn Moreabout Bilt Palladium CardTerms Apply\nSee rates & fees\n\nNEW CARD ALERT\n\nBest for housing payments\n\nBilt Palladium Card\n\n50,000 Bilt Points + Gold Status + $300 of Bilt Cash\n\ngtm--top-offer-11038\n• Learn Moreabout Capital One Venture Rewards Credit CardTerms Apply\nSee rates & fees\n\nLIMITED-TIME OFFER\n\nBEST FOR TRAVEL REWARDS\n\nCapital One Venture Rewards Credit Card\n\nEnjoy a $250 travel credit & earn 75K bonus miles\n\ngtm--top-offer-22105772\n• Learn Moreabout The Business Platinum Card® from American ExpressTerms Apply\nSee rates & fees\n\nELEVATED WELCOME OFFER\n\nBest Business Travel Card\n\nThe Business Platinum Card® from American Express\n\nEarn 200,000 Membership Rewards® points\n\ngtm--top-offer-7758\n• Learn Moreabout American Express Platinum Card®Terms Apply\nSee rates & fees\n\nBest luxury travel rewards card\n\nAmerican Express Platinum Card®\n\nAs High As 175,000 points.

It offers a great welcome bonus, and cardholders can earn tons of miles on everyday spending, in addition to receiving a 10,000-mile anniversary bonus to boot. It has an annual fee of $395, but cardholders can count on a $300 annual credit toward travel booked through Capital One Travel each year and other valuable benefits, like access to Capital One’s growing family of airport lounges. (Partner offer)\n\nRead the full review\n\n### Pros\n\n• $300 in annual credits toward bookings made through Capital One Travel\n• 10,000 bonus miles each account anniversary\n\n### Cons\n\n• If you don’t travel frequently, this might not be the best card for you\n\n### Who is this card good for?\n\nThe Capital One Venture X is great for folks looking to get more from their travel experience. Capital One miles can be redeemed for one cent apiece toward travel, but they can also be transferred to 15-plus airline and hotel partners, including Air Canada Aeroplan and Choice Privileges, which can open up tremendous travel opportunities. If you frequent airports, the card will get you into over 1,300 lounges worldwide through participating Priority Pass™ lounges (after enrollment), not to mention Capital One’s swanky lounges, the first of which opened at Dallas-Fort Worth in 2021. The Venture X is also a fantastic all-round earner, accumulating up to 10 miles per dollar spent on hotels and car rentals booked through Capital One, 5 miles per dollar spent on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One travel, and 2 miles per dollar spent on other purchases. This way, you can rack up even more travel rewards on your everyday spending.\n\n## Earning Rewards\n\nYou can earn 2 miles per dollar spent on everyday purchases, 5 miles per dollar on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel and 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.",

She joined the TPG team in 2023 and is excited to take points and miles beginners with her on a journey toward maximizing rewards.\n\nDanyal Ahmed\n\nDanyal Ahmed\nCredit card writer\n\nCredit card writer Danyal Ahmed is an avid traveler, averaging about 100,000 aeronautical miles per year. He regularly applies that knowledge and his expertise in credit cards to his role as a credit card writer at TPG.\n\nalso contributed to this story\n\nDec. 29, 2025\n\n•\n\n5 min read\n\nJump to section\n\n• Facebook\n• Twitter\n• LinkedIn\n• Copy URL\n• Email\n\nThe cards we feature here are from partners who compensate us when you are approved through our site, and this may impact how or where these products appear. We don’t cover all available credit cards, but our analysis, reviews, and opinions are entirely from our editorial team. Terms apply to the offers listed on this page. Please view our advertising policy and product review methodology for more information.\n\n### Editor's Note\n\nThis is a recurring post, regularly updated with new information and offers.\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card stands tall in the travel credit card market. This is thanks to its straightforward benefits, ability to earn valuable Capital One miles and annual fee of $395, modest compared to its premium counterparts.\n\nLet's dive into the Venture X's bonus and benefits to help you decide whether now is the time to add the card to your wallet.\n\n## Current Capital One Venture X offer\n\nNew Venture X applicants can earn 75,000 bonus miles after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nAccording to TPG's December 2025 valuations, this bonus is worth $1,388.\n\nGet updates on special offers and compare our editors’ top credit card picks with our daily newsletter.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\nCapital One miles are most valuable when you leverage one of the issuer's 15-plus transfer partners. However, cardholders also have the option to redeem at a fixed rate of 1 cent per point to cover recent travel purchases on the card or make bookings through the Capital One Travel portal. This bonus is worth a respectable $750 if you redeem it this way.\n\n### Application rules and restrictions\n\nCapital One has imposed a 48-month family rule across its lineup of Venture cards, including the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card and the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card.\n\nThis new Venture family rule restricts you from moving 'down' the Venture card family (in terms of annual fees), meaning if you already have the Venture X and earned the bonus in the last 48 months, you won't be approved for the VentureOne ($0 annual fee) or Venture ($95 annual fee). So, that's something to keep in mind if you want to pick up one of these two lower-tier cards in the future.\n\nAdditionally, if you've opened the Venture X and received its bonus in the last 48 months, you won't be eligible for this current bonus.\n\nCapital One's other application restrictions require you to wait six months between approvals for new Capital One cards, including both personal and business cards.\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\n\nJoin over 1,000,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts\n\n**Related: 6 things to do when you get the Capital One Venture X**\n\n## Why you should apply for the Venture X",

Key perks include:\n\n• **Anniversary bonus:** The card pays 10,000 bonus miles on your account anniversary, starting on your first anniversary. As of December 2025, TPG values those 10,000 miles at up to $185 when utilized with Capital One's transfer partners.\n• **Annual travel credit:** Cardholders will receive a $300 annual credit for bookings made through Capital One Travel.\n• **Authorized users:**Additional authorized users can be added at no charge. However, beginning Feb. 1, 2026, each authorized user will cost $125 annually to retain Capital One and Priority Pass lounge access.\n• **Global Entry or TSA PreCheck:** Cardholders receive up to $120 in statement credits for either TSA PreCheck or Global Entry.\n• **Lounge access:** Cardholders, authorized users and up to two guests per visit get complimentary access to Capital One lounges and more than 1,300 Priority Pass lounges until Feb. 1, 2026. After this date, you'll be required to pay for guest access to both types of lounges.\n• **Luxury hotel perks:** The Capital One Premier Collection offers free breakfast, room upgrades and other perks at participating hotels and resorts. Cardholders can also access Capital One's lower-tier Lifestyle Collection.\n• **Stacking car rental perks:**Cardholders can stack car rental perks with Hertz.*\n\nCardMatch\n\nLet us help find the best card for you\n\nGet personalized card matches to maximize your earning potential. Let's get started.\n\nHow do you want to redeem your rewards?\n\nBooking travel and travel experiences\n\nCash back and statement credits\n\nTake me to CardMatch\n\n_*Upon enrollment, accessible through the Capital One website or mobile app, eligible cardholders will remain at that status level through the duration of the offer. Please note, enrolling through the normal Hertz Gold Plus Rewards enrollment process (e.g. at Hertz.com) will not automatically detect a cardholder as being eligible for the program and cardholders will not be automatically upgraded to the applicable status tier. Additional terms apply._\n\nOSCAR WONG/GETTY IMAGES\nOn top of these benefits, the Venture X makes it easy to earn Capital One miles at competitive rates:\n\n• 10 miles per dollar spent on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel\n• 5 miles per dollar spent on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel\n• 2 miles per dollar spent on all other purchases\n\nIf you maximize the full value of just two of the Venture X's annual perks — the $300 travel credit and 10,000 bonus points — you will effectively recoup your $395 annual fee. That's because TPG's December 2025 valuations place the bonus points at $185. When you add the value of the $300 credit to this, you reach a total annual value of $485.\n\n**Related: Cashing in Capital One miles? How to get the maximum value when redeeming miles**\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe Venture X can be a great option for many travelers, and the card will likely become more compelling over time as Capital One continues to invest in its rewards program and expand its lounge network.\n\nTo learn more, read our full review of the Venture X.\n\n**Learn more: Capital One Venture X**",

    "content": "The information and associated card details on this page for the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, and Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card have been collected independently by OMAAT and has not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\n**Link: Learn more about the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card**\n\nThe Capital One Venture X has quickly become one of the most popular premium credit cards. While the card has a $395 annual fee, that fee is extremely easy to justify, thanks to the amazing perks, huge bonus, and great return on spending.\n\nWhile I’ve written a detailed review of this card, in this post I wanted to share 13 reasons you should apply for the Capital One Venture X.\n\nIn this post:\n\n## Welcome bonus of 75,000 Capital One miles\n\nThe Capital One Venture X is offering an excellent welcome bonus of 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months. Personally I value Capital One miles at 1.7 cents each, so to me 75,000 miles are worth ~$1,275, which is a phenomenal bonus.\n\nSee this post for Venture X application tips & guidelines. Note that you’re eligible for this card (including the bonus) even if you have the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (review).\nRedeem 75K Capital One miles for great flight experiences\n## 2x Capital One miles on everyday spending\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers unlimited 2x miles on all purchases, making this one of the best cards for everyday spending. I value Capital One miles at 1.7 cents each, so to me that’s the equivalent of a 3.4% return on everyday spending. This is the card that I spend the most money on nowadays.\n\nIn addition to earning 2x miles on all purchases, the card also offers some bonuses:\n\n• Earn 10x miles for rental cars and hotels booked through Capital One Travel\n• Earn 5x miles for flights booked through Capital One Travel\nRewards rack up quickly when you earn 2x miles\n## No foreign transaction fees\n\nThe Capital One Venture X has no foreign transaction fees. While that’s expected for a premium card, I think that’s especially worth calling out, given the card’s otherwise excellent return on spending. I consider this to be the single best card to use for purchases abroad.\n\n## A flexible & valuable mileage currency\n\nCapital One miles have become increasingly valuable in recent years, and there are lots of great ways to redeem these miles. While you can redeem Capital One miles for one cent each toward virtually any purchase, that’s not my preferred use of these miles.\n\nRather my preference is to transfer miles to Capital One’s airline & hotel partners, as you can transfer miles at a 1:1 ratio to over a dozen partners. As is the case with all major transferable points currencies, this allows you to get way outsized value, especially when redeeming for first & business class travel.\nTransfer Capital One miles to Emirates Skywards for first class travel\n## $300 annual Capital One Travel credit\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers a $300 credit for Capital One Travel every cardmember year, which can be used for flights, hotels, rental cars, etc. Personally my strategy is to just book a $300+ flight through the portal every year, and that’s an easy way to recoup the full value of that.",

    "content": "As mentioned above, the card has a $395 annual fee, but that $300 credit alone should easily offset more than 75% of that fee, which is awesome. So while the card’s annual fee might seem high on the surface, it shouldn’t really be costing anyone all that much to hold onto.\nRedeem the $300 travel credit toward the cost of a flight\n## Anniversary 10,000 Venture bonus miles\n\nNot only does the Capital One Venture X offer a $300 credit every cardmember year, but it also offers 10,000 miles on your account anniversary every year. Personally I value those 10,000 miles at ~$170, meaning your annual fee is more than covered between these two perks alone.\n\n## Priority Pass™ Select membership\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers a Priority Pass™ Select membership, which gets you access to the world’s largest network of airport lounges, with 1,300+ locations around the world.\nAccess 1,300+ lounges worldwide with Priority Pass\n## Capital One Lounge access\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers unlimited access to Capital One Lounges. Currently Capital One has three lounges, including in Dallas (DFW), Denver (DEN), and Washington (IAD), with more locations expected in the future. These are fantastic lounges, among the best in the United States, so having access to Capital One Lounges is a treat.\nThe Capital One Lounge DFW is amazing\n## Capital One Landing access\n\nIn addition to Capital One Lounge access, the Capital One Venture X also offers access to the new Capital One Landing concept, with the first location having now opened in Washington (DCA).\n\nThis is a twist on the traditional airport lounge concept. Think of this as almost being like an airport restaurant, with complimentary food and drinks. Capital One Landing is offered in partnership with Chef José Andrés, and you can expect a tapas-style dining experience, plus an extensive drink selection.\nThe Capital One Landing DCA is a unique concept\n## Hertz President’s Circle status\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers Hertz President’s Circle status for as long as you’re cardmember. This status with Hertz comes with perks like being able to skip the counter, guaranteed upgrades, free additional drivers, and more. Rental car elite status like this really takes the pain out of the typical rental car experience.\nGet car upgrades as a Hertz President’s Circle member\n## Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers a TSA PreCheck or Global Entry credit once every four years. Just charge the enrollment fee to your card, and it will automatically be reimbursed. Even if you already have Global Entry or TSA PreCheck, you can always use this for someone else, as long as your card is used to pay.\nGet a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit\n## Cell phone protection\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers a cell phone protection plan. Just pay your monthly bill with the card, and you’ll be protected if your phone is stolen or damaged, minus a $50 deductible. Given how expensive smartphones are nowadays, this is a great perk, and the Venture X offers among the best coverage of any card.\nGet cell phone protection with the card\n## Rental car & travel protection\n\nWhen considering a premium credit, I recommend getting one that offers valuable travel coverage, since that can come in handy when you least expect it.

I’d say this card is almost too good to be true, thanks to all the amazing benefits it offers for a reasonable fee. The Venture X has a big welcome bonus, a great return on everyday spending, lounge access, and lots of valuable travel perks.\n\nLet’s take a look at all aspects of the card, including the welcome bonus, annual fee, rewards structure, perks, and more.\n\nIn this post:\n\n## Capital One Venture X 75K miles welcome bonus\n\nThe Capital One Venture X is offering a welcome bonus of 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months. Personally, I value Capital One miles at 1.7 cents each, so to me, the 75,000 miles are worth ~$1,275. This is one of the best credit card bonuses out there.\n\nNote that you’re eligible for this card (including the bonus) even if you have the standard Venture product, so you can apply outright.

Anecdotal reports suggest that a lot of people are having luck with approvals for the Capital One Venture X, which is great. A few things to note:\n\n• Yes, you are eligible for the Capital One Venture X (including the bonus) even if you have the Capital One Venture, but you need to apply outright; product changing doesn’t qualify for the bonus\n• If you’re added as an authorized user on the Capital One Venture X (or any other Capital One card), you are eligible to apply for the card yourself in the future, and receive the bonus\n• Capital One doesn’t seem to have any consistent rules when it comes to getting approved, at least not like Amex and Chase; people with all kinds of credit profiles are reporting approvals\n• Capital One pulls your credit from all three bureaus when you apply, though personally I don’t consider that to be a big deal\n\nLearn more about getting approved for the Capital One Venture X.\nMany are having luck getting approved for the Venture X\n## Capital One Venture X $395 annual fee\n\nThe Capital One Venture X has a $395 annual fee. Note that this annual fee is for the primary card member, and then you can add up to four authorized user cards at no extra cost.",

Note that this annual fee is for the primary card member, and then you can add up to four authorized user cards at no extra cost.\n\nWhile that annual fee might sound significant, everyone who considers this card should be able to get outsized value from that fee, and holding onto the card should end up costing you very little. I’ll talk about that in more detail below, but the card offers two annual benefits that more than offset the annual fee, in my opinion.\n\n## Capital One Venture X rewards structure\n\nThe Capital One Venture X has a lucrative rewards structure, and offers 2-10x Capital One miles per dollar spent, all with no foreign transaction fees. Let’s go over the details of each of these points.\n\n### Venture X 5-10x miles with Capital One Travel\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers bonus rewards for travel booked through the Capital One Travel portal. Specifically, you can earn 10x miles on hotels and rental cars booked via Capital One Travel, and 5x miles on flights booked via Capital One Travel.\n\nBased on my valuation of 1.7 cents per Capital One mile, that’s like a 17% return on hotels and rental cars, and an 8.5% return on flights. Some people might find it to be worthwhile to book through Capital One Travel to earn those rewards, but there’s often an opportunity cost to using a portal.\nEarn up to 10x Capital One miles with Capital One Travel\n### Venture X 2x miles on all other purchases\n\nOne of the greatest things about the Capital One Venture X is that it offers a minimum of 2x Capital One miles on all purchases. That makes this one of the best cards for everyday spending, as I value that at a 3.4% return on spending. I’d highly recommend using this card as your personal card for everyday spending, since you won’t find a better return on any other card, in my opinion.\n\nWhile some other cards may have lucrative bonus categories, you can’t beat the ease and general value of earning 2x miles on all purchases.\nEarn a minimum of 2x Capital One miles on all purchases\n### Venture X no foreign transaction fees\n\nThe Capital One Venture X has no foreign transaction fees, making it a great card for purchases abroad. Not only can you avoid foreign transaction fees (which can be around 3% on some other cards), but you can earn rewards abroad as well.\nMake purchases abroad with no foreign transaction fees\n## Capital One Venture X perks & rewards\n\nThe Capital One Venture X really stands out when it comes to the perks offered by the card. This includes everything from a $300 annual Capital One Travel credit, to 10,000 Venture anniversary bonus miles, to lounge access, and much, much more.\n\n### Venture X $300 annual Capital One Travel credit\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers a $300 annual credit that can be used through Capital One Travel, starting your first year. You can apply this to a $300 purchase through Capital One Travel, and can use it toward a flight, hotel, or rental car. This is quite straightforward to use — my preferred method is to simply book a $300+ flight, and get $300 off that purchase amount.",

At a minimum, you can redeem those 10,000 miles for one cent each toward a travel purchase, so that’s worth a minimum of $100. However, if you’re a savvy points redeemer, you can get even more value out of that perk.\nRedeem Capital One miles for Emirates first class\n### Venture X Priority Pass™ Select membership\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers the primary card member a Priority Pass™ Select membership. A Priority Pass™ Select membership provides access to 1,300+ lounges around the world.\nAccess airport lounges worldwide with Priority Pass\n### Venture X Capital One Lounge access\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers the primary card member access to Capital One Lounges. These are excellent lounges, much better than your typical Priority Pass lounge. They feature grab & go food, cold brew on tap, and delicious food and drinks to enjoy in the lounge.\n\nCapital One Venture X card members receive unlimited visits to Capital One Lounges; if you fly out of DFW, IAD, or DEN with any frequency, there’s big value to having access to a Capital One Lounge, in my opinion.\nAccess Capital One Lounges with the card\n### Venture X Capital One Landing access\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers the primary card member access to Capital One Landings.\n\nThink of Capital One Landings as essentially being top notch airport restaurants, with menus designed by Chef José Andrés. It’s really a great twist on the traditional lounge concept, since it’s a place to get great food and drinks before your flight, without actually visiting a traditional lounge.\n\nCapital One Venture X card members receive unlimited visits to Capital One Landings.\nAccess Capital One Landings with the card\n### Venture X Plaza Premium Lounge access\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers access to Plaza Premium Lounges for the primary card member.\n\nNowadays many Plaza Premium Lounges also participate in Priority Pass, so you can access many of these lounges in two ways. However, there are some lounges that participate exclusively in Priority Pass, or that have better terms when accessing through a card directly offering Plaza Premium access.\nAccess Plaza Premium Lounges with the card\n### Venture X Hertz President’s Circle elite status\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers Hertz President’s Circle status for the primary card member and authorized users. This status with Hertz offers perks like being able to skip the counter, guaranteed upgrades, free additional drivers, and more. If you rent from Hertz with any frequency, this should be worth quite a bit.\nReceive Hertz President’s Circle status with the card\n### Venture X Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers a TSA PreCheck or Global Entry fee credit once every four years. You just have to charge the application fee to your card, and it will automatically be reimbursed. Both of these programs offer a lot of value if you’re a frequent flyer. I recommend signing up for Global Entry, since that comes with TSA PreCheck, while the inverse isn’t true.\nGet a TSA PreCheck credit with the card\n## Capital One Venture X purchase protection (rental cars, travel, cell phones)",

    "content": "One thing that many people look for in premium credit cards is great purchase protection. The Capital One Venture X is a Visa Infinite Card, and as a result, it offers some valuable peace of mind:\n\n• For rental cars, the Venture X offers primary rental car coverage; just decline the collision damage waiver offered by the car rental company, and pay for the full price of the rental with your card\n• For cell phones, the Venture X offers cell phone protection; just pay your monthly bill with the card, and you’ll be protected with a $50 deductible\n• For flights, the Venture X offers trip delay reimbursement; pay for your airline ticket with the card, and if you’re delayed by more than six hours or have an overnight stay, you can be reimbursed up to $500 for reasonable expenses incurred because of the delay\n• For luggage, the Venture X offers lost luggage reimbursement; pay for your airline ticket with the card, and if your bag is lost, you can be reimbursed\n\nOf course, you’ll want to consult the card member agreement for all the terms, since there are always some restrictions associated with this coverage. But this is incredibly well-rounded coverage, and what I look for in a premium card.\nReceive cell phone protection with the card\n## How to redeem Capital One miles\n\nAs you can see above, the Capital One Venture X earns Capital One miles, and you earn a minimum of 2x miles per dollar spent on purchases. How can you actually redeem those miles, though? There are a couple of ways to most efficiently redeem Capital One miles:\n\n• Miles can be redeemed for one cent each toward the cost of a travel purchase\n• Miles can be transferred to Capital One’s airline and hotel partners, typically at a 1:1 ratio\n\nLet’s briefly talk about both of those redemption methods.\n\n### Redeem Capital One miles toward travel costs\n\nOne way to redeem Capital One miles is at the rate of one cent per mile toward the cost of a travel purchase. This means you’re earning two cents per dollar spent toward travel, since the card offers unlimited 2x miles.\n\nIf you want to redeem your miles toward the cost of a travel purchase, the best way to do so is with covering travel purchases. With this, you can make an eligible travel purchase using your card, and then you can go online after the fact and use your miles to pay for the purchase within 90 days of the date of purchase. Your credit will then be applied within two to three days.\n\nEligible travel purchases using your Capital One miles include purchases made from airlines, hotels, rail lines, car rental agencies, limousine services, bus lines, cruise lines, taxi cabs, travel agents, and timeshares.\n\nIt’s so nice to have the flexibility to make your travel purchase however you’d like, and then have the purchase reimbursed after the fact. Alternatively, you can book through the Capital One Travel Portal, and pay for your purchase directly with miles.\n\nI can’t emphasize enough how lucrative it is to at least get a return of two cents on the dollar on all your business spending. A vast majority of people using travel rewards cards for everyday spending aren’t getting that level of return.\nUse your Capital One miles for a stay at a luxury hotel\n### Convert Capital One miles into airline or hotel points",

    "content": "Personally my preferred way to redeem Capital One miles is to transfer them to Capital One’s airline and hotel partners. Capital One has nearly 20 travel partners, ranging from Air Canada Aeroplan, to Air France-KLM Flying Blue, to British Airways Executive Club, to Emirates Skywards, to Turkish Airlines Miles&Smiles.\n\nIf you put some effort into learning how to redeem miles & points, you can get way outsized value this way. For example, a one-way Air France business class award across the Atlantic starts at just 50,000 miles one-way. That’s how I recently flew Air France’s amazing new A350 business class from New York to Paris.\n\nIf paying cash, that ticket would cost have thousands of dollars. Meanwhile I booked it for just 50,000 miles, the equivalent of $500 worth of travel. Not bad, eh?\nBook business class tickets with Capital One miles\n## Is the Capital One Venture X worth it?\n\nThe Capital One Venture X is jaw-droppingly generous, and that’s not even accounting for the card’s welcome bonus. The card has a $395 annual fee, which is lower than the fees of other premium credit cards. But the card shouldn’t be costing anyone nearly that much, between the $300 annual Capital One Travel credit, and the 10,000 anniversary bonus miles. To me you’re coming out ahead without even using the card for everyday spending.\n\nThat doesn’t even factor in that the card has huge value beyond that — the Capital One Venture X offers an industry-leading 2x miles per dollar spent, and most significantly, offers access to Capital One Lounges and Capital One Landings, plus a Priority Pass™ Select membership.\n\nApplying for this card is an absolute no-brainer, in my opinion. While there are lower annual fee versions of the Capital One Venture, the math adds up here.\nThe Capital One Lounge DFW is awesome\n### How does the Capital One Venture X Business compare?\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Business (review) is the business version of the Capital One Venture X. While I think there’s something to be said for having both cards, how do the two cards compare?\n\n• What the cards have in common is that they have the same annual fees, same rewards structure, and they both offer a $300 annual travel credit, 10,000 anniversary bonus miles, a Priority Pass™ Select membership, Capital One Lounge access, and Capital One Landing access.\n• The personal version of the card has the advantage of offering cell phone protection\n• The business version of the card has the advantage of offering a much bigger bonus (though also with a bigger spending requirement), and of having no preset spending limit\n\nI’d say both cards are incredibly lucrative. The personal version of the card is perhaps more of a slam dunk in terms of value, and almost falls into the “too good to be true” category. Like I said, given that there’s almost no cost to holding onto these cards (due to the perks), I think there’s merit to having both cards. That’s the situation I’m in.\n\n## Capital One Venture X FAQs\n\nThere are some questions I’ve received over and over about the Capital One Venture X, so I figured I’d answer those in a consolidated way in the form of some frequently asked questions. If there are any questions I haven’t answered in this post, please let me know in the comments, and I’ll be sure to incorporate that as well. In no particular order…\n\n#### Are you eligible for the Venture X if you have the Venture?",

    "content": "#### Are you eligible for the Venture X if you have the Venture?\n\nYep, you sure are. You can just apply outright, and you’re eligible for the card, including the bonus. While there might be opportunities to product change, you generally won’t receive a bonus for product changing.\n\n#### Can you product change to the Venture X?\n\nIf you have another personal Capital One travel rewards card, like the Venture, you may be able to product change to the Venture X. You’ll have to phone up Capital One to see what options are available to you. However, note that you aren’t eligible for the welcome bonus if you product change.\n\n#### How many authorized users can you add to the Venture X?\n\nYou can add up to four authorized users to the Venture X at no extra cost.\n\n#### What lounge access does the Venture X offer?\n\nThe Venture X offers a Priority Pass™ Select membership, getting you access to 1,300+ lounges around the world, with the ability to take up to two guests. Additionally, it offers access to Plaza Premium Lounges, with the ability to take up to two guests. You can access Capital One Lounges (with two guests) and Capital One Landings (with one guest). These perks apply to the primary card member.\nAccess Priority Pass lounges with the card\n#### What credit score do you need to be approved for the Venture X?\n\nThere’s not a specific credit score you need to be approved for the Venture X, though the card is generally intended for those with good to excellent credit. Capital One has fairly few consistent rules about approvals otherwise, and reports suggest that a lot of people are successfully being approved for the card.\n\n#### When does the Venture X welcome bonus end?\n\nThe Venture X is offering a bonus of 75,000 miles after meeting minimum spend requirements. I have no indication of if/when this bonus will change.\nRedeem miles for some awesome business class flights\n#### Is the Venture X card made of metal?\n\nYep, the Capital One Venture X is indeed made of metal.\n\n#### How can you redeem the Venture X $300 travel credit?\n\nThe Venture X $300 travel credit is issued each anniversary year (including the first year), and can be used toward any purchase in the Capital One Travel portal. This includes purchasing flights, hotels, rental cars, etc. For most people this should be more or less good as cash toward travel.\nRedeem the Venture X $300 travel credit toward a hotel stay\n#### How does the Venture X 10K anniversary bonus miles work?\n\nThe Venture X offers an automatic 10,000 bonus miles on the account anniversary every year. This couldn’t be more straightforward, as the miles will automatically post to your account. You can redeem them whenever you’d like, however you’d like. 10,000 miles could get you $100 worth of travel, or alternatively could get you up to 10,000 bonus miles with one of Capital One’s airline partners.\n\n#### Is the Venture X a Mastercard or Visa?\n\nThe Venture X is a Visa Infinite Card, which is Visa’s most premium type of credit card.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe Capital One Venture X is Capital One’s premium personal travel card, and I’d argue it’s the single most lucrative card on the market.",

Please check out our advertiser policy for further details about our partners, and thanks for your support!\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card (review) and Capital One Venture X Business (review) have in recent years become popular premium travel credit cards, offering great value. This includes everything from a $300 annual travel credit, to 10,000 anniversary bonus miles, to valuable airport lounge access.\n\nAspects of the cards almost seemed too good to be true, so several months back we learned how Capital One would be making changes to airport lounge access benefits, which are overwhelmingly negative (I suppose unless you consider fewer people potentially having lounge access to be a good thing, as crowding has become an issue). These changes are now live, so I’d like to go over all the details.\n\nIn this post:\n\n## Capital One lounge access changes as of February 2026\n\nAs of February 1, 2026, we’ve seen changes to Capital One lounge access, which impact access to Capital One Lounges, Capital One Landings, and participating Priority Pass lounges. The exact changes differ between the personal and business cards, since the cards also have different lounge access benefits.\n\nThese changes include two main areas — lounge access for authorized users, and the ability to guest others into lounges. Let me start by recapping the old policies, before the changes were implemented.\n\nWith the old Capital One Venture X lounge access policy:\n\n• The primary card member and up to four authorized users could all receive the same lounge access perks (there was no cost to add those authorized users)\n• Card members could access Capital One Lounges with up to two guests, and Capital One Landings with up to one guest\n• Card members could receive a Priority Pass™ Select membership, with the ability to bring two guests\n\nWith the old Capital One Venture X Business lounge access policy:\n\n• The primary card member could receive lounge access, but authorized users didn’t receive any lounge access perks\n• Card members could access Capital One Lounges with up to two guests, and Capital One Landings with up to one guest\n• Card members could receive a Priority Pass™ Select membership, with the ability to bring two guests for free\n\nHere’s how Capital One describes the logic for these changes, in a statement:\n\nAs airport lounges continue to grow in popularity across the industry, we’ve seen our customers increasingly encounter wait times to enter them. It is important to us that we maintain a great airport lounge experience for our Venture X and Venture X Business customers, while continuing to deliver best-in-class premium travel cards at an accessible price point.",

    "content": "To address this, we will be making some changes to lounge access for additional cardholders (authorized users and account managers) and guests. Venture X and Venture X Business primary cardholders will continue to receive complimentary access to over 1,300 lounges, including Capital One Lounges, Capital One Landings and Priority Pass lounges. We thought carefully about these changes, and we remain committed to delivering a differentiated premium travel card for our customers.\nThere are major Capital One lounge access changes\n### Capital One $125 authorized user lounge access fee\n\nAs of February 1, 2026, authorized users on the Capital One Venture X no longer automatically receive any lounge access perks. Instead, card members are able to pay $125 per authorized user to get lounge access, for up to four people.\n\nNote that this applies to both the personal and business card, so the ability for authorized users to get lounge access on the business card is a new development.\n\nThis applies for all types of lounge access, including for Capital One Lounges, Capital One Landings, and Priority Pass™ Select memberships. Obviously this is a major change, since the personal version of the card previously allowed you to add four authorized users at no cost, which is a value of up to $500 under the new system.\n\nAs of February 2026, you have the option of designating whether you want authorized users to have lounge access or not. The default is for them to have no access (in which case there’s no fee for authorized users).\nThere are new fees for authorized user lounge access\n### Capital One $75,000 annual spending for lounge guests\n\nAs of February 1, 2026, the Capital One Venture X and Capital One Venture X Business no longer automatically come with complimentary guests when accessing Capital One Lounges and Capital One Landings.\n\nInstead, only the card member as such receives access. The exception is if you spend $75,000 per year across the card account, in which case you continue to enjoy the same guesting privileges. This includes two guests at Capital One Lounges, and one guest at Capital One Landings.\n\nJust to clarify a few points:\n\n• The $75,000 spending requirement is per calendar year and per account (between the primary card member and authorized users)\n• Spending in the 2025 calendar year was the first to count toward this, and when you unlock the spending requirement, you get the increased lounge access for the current calendar year and the following calendar year\n• The ability to guest people into lounges applies to both the primary card member and authorized users who have paid $125 for the lounge access pass\n• Card members can still guest people into lounges at the rate of $45 per adult, and $25 per guest 17 and under, while children under two remain complimentary\nThere’s a new spending requirement for guesting people\n### Capital One Priority Pass benefits changes\n\nAs of February 1, 2026, the Capital One Venture X Priority Pass™ Select membership no longer comes with guesting privileges. This only applies to the personal version of the card, and not to the business version of the card (which continues to allow two complimentary guests).",

    "content": "As of February 1, 2026, the Capital One Venture X Priority Pass™ Select membership no longer comes with guesting privileges. This only applies to the personal version of the card, and not to the business version of the card (which continues to allow two complimentary guests).\n\nInstead, those with a Priority Pass™ Select membership through the Venture X have to pay $35 per person for any guests they bring into Priority Pass lounges. This applies even if the $75,000 spending requirement is met, as that only allows guesting at Capital One Lounge and Capital One Landing locations.\nThere are even cuts to Priority Pass lounge access\n## My take on Capital One lounge access changes\n\nObviously these Capital One Venture X lounge access changes are negative, as card members are getting less value than before. In fairness, it has been around five years since the Venture X was introduced, so it’s hardly surprising to see some significant changes, especially with how the premium credit card landscape has evolved.\n\nCapital One is following the industry trend here, as lounge crowding has become a major issue. I suspect these changes will materially reduce crowding levels, since there’s no more free lounge access for authorized users, and even the ability to bring guests for free comes with a significant spending requirement.\n\nI guess if there’s one silver lining, it’s that on the business version of the card, it’s now possible to add lounge access for authorized users at a reasonable cost, which wasn’t previously the case.\n\nWhen it comes to the new spending requirement for guesting people into lounges, at least the Venture X is a rewarding card for everyday spending, so many people will be able to efficiently reach that spending requirement.\n\nObviously this is a negative change. It’ll probably cause quite a few people to cancel the card. Personally, it doesn’t change the card’s fundamental value proposition, since I consider the $395 annual fee to be offset by the $300 annual travel credit and 10,000 anniversary bonus miles, and everything else is just the icing on the cake.\n\nThe change to Priority Pass guesting on the personal version of the card is also significant, if you ask me, since it doesn’t set a great precedent. Up until now, most premium cards in the US have allowed at least two guests into lounges.\n\nThis also reflects the bigger reality of premium credit cards. There’s such a race for premium market share between card issuers, and the economics also have to work. So presumably Capital One hopes that it’ll generate more in fees with these changes, while also increasing card member spending. It’s obvious that this isn’t just about limiting lounge crowding, but is also about economics, since even Priority Pass guesting has been cut.\nI can’t say that I’m surprised to see these changes\n## Bottom line\n\nAs of February 2026, Capital One has made huge changes to its Venture X lounge access policy.\n\nCardmembers on both the personal and business version of the card now need to pay $125 per authorized user for lounge access, which is a huge devaluation for the personal version, and an improvement for the business version. There’s also a $75,000 annual spending requirement to guest people into Capital One Lounges and Capital One Landings. Lastly, the personal version of the card no longer offers complimentary guests at Priority Pass lounges.\n\nThis is a negative development, and will likely cause many people to reconsider these cards. Personally, it doesn’t alter the fundamental value proposition of the Venture X for me, so it won’t cause me to cancel. And there’s no denying that lounge crowding has become a serious issue, so hopefully this makes a significant difference.\n\n**What do you make of these Capital One Venture X lounge access changes?**\n\nRead More\n\nMust-Read: A Yale Academic’s Bizarre Defense Of\n\nAmerican CEO Robert Isom",

While each card has a $395 annual fee, the cards offer all kinds of perks that help offset that fee.\n\nThe way I view it, the two biggest perks that help justify the annual fee are the $300 annual Capital One Travel credit and the 10,000 anniversary bonus miles. In this post I wanted to take a closer look at the $300 annual Capital One Travel credit offered by the cards, and how exactly this perk works. Several premium credit cards offer travel credits, but they all work differently, so let’s get into all the details of how this one works.\n\nIn this post:\n\n## How does the Venture X $300 annual travel credit work?\n\nThe Capital One Venture X offers a $300 annual travel credit, which can be redeemed through Capital One Travel. Here’s what you need to know about that:\n\n• The credit applies each cardmember year (or anniversary year, if you prefer), including the year in which you open the card; the credit timing isn’t based on the calendar year\n• The credit can be used across one or multiple transactions, until the $300 limit is reached\n• There’s no registration required to use the $300 annual travel credit\n• Any purchase through Capital One Travel or Capital One Business Travel qualifies toward using this credit, so this credit can be used toward flights, hotels, or rental cars\n• If you want to use the credit, simply select that you want to pay with the credit during checkout; when this benefit first launched it was issued as a statement credit after the fact, but that’s no longer the case\n• If you can cancel a refundable trip booked with the credit, then you can have that credit reinstated, up to the standard expiration date\nThe Capital One Travel credit shows in your account\n## What travel can you book through Capital One Travel?\n\nCapital One Travel is Capital One’s travel portal, as you may have guessed based on the name. The portal is powered by Hopper, and Capital One is essentially acting as the travel agent here. You can use Capital One Travel to book everything from flights, to hotels, to rental cars.",

You can easily search flights, hotels, and rental cars.\nCapital One Travel portal\nThe portal has some nifty features. For example, when searching flights, there’s a calendar showing the dates with the best prices, which is something I wish we’d more consistently see from airlines.\nCapital One Travel portal\nSimilarly, the option to filter results is great, better than with most other portals, in my opinion.\nCapital One Travel portal\nIf you wanted to apply your $300 annual travel credit toward a purchase (like a flight), you’d just want to start the process of purchasing a flight. Then on the checkout page, you should see the credit automatically applied, unless you specifically choose not to apply it.\nCapital One Travel portal\nKeep in mind that the Venture X is also rewarding for purchases through Capital One Travel, so you can earn lots of miles for purchases beyond the amount that the credit covers. The card offers:\n\n• 10x Capital One miles on hotels and rental cars booked via Capital One Travel\n• 5x Capital One miles on flights and vacation rentals booked via Capital One Travel\n\nFor what it’s worth, I value Capital One miles at 1.7 cents each, so that’s like an 8.5-17% return on that spending.\nApply your $300 credit toward a flight\n## But isn’t booking through credit card travel portals annoying?\n\nSome people are probably thinking “I don’t really want to book through a travel portal though.” I hear you. To be honest, I only rarely use travel portals. Even if a travel portal is great, there are downsides to using them:\n\n• On the flight front, in the event of schedule changes or wanting to cancel, it can be easier to do so if you book direct, especially in an era where airlines largely allow free ticket changes\n• On the hotel front, you don’t usually receive elite perks or earn points when booking through a third party\n• On the rental car front, there are often discount codes available online that can’t be used if booking through a portal, and elite perks also often don’t apply through third party bookings\n\nThat being said, I still think the credit is worth pretty close to face value, and have no issues whatsoever using it. What’s my strategy? To keep things simple, my strategy is to book a single flight that costs $300+ at least once per year, which triggers the $300 credit.\n\nYou still generally earn points and receive elite perks when booking flights through a portal, and the pricing is almost always identical. Therefore the opportunity cost to booking this way is limited.\n\nThe way I see it, having to book through Capital One Travel is hardly a huge deal or anything that prevents this from being maximized, and most people shouldn’t have any issues taking advantage of this.\nBooking a flight through a portal isn’t a big deal\n## How does this compare to travel credits on other cards?\n\nHow does the Capital One Venture X $300 annual travel credit compare to the credits issued by other premium cards?

    "content": "How does the Capital One Venture X $300 annual travel credit compare to the credits issued by other premium cards? Just to compare:\n\n• The Chase Sapphire Reserve® Card (review) has a $300 annual travel credit that can apply toward any travel purchase, and it doesn’t have to be booked through Chase’s travel portal; this continues to be the easiest to use travel credit\n• American Express Platinum Card® (review) offers all kinds of credits, including an up to $200 airline fee credit (Enrollment required); this is rather complicated to use, and includes all kinds of restrictions\n\nI’d argue that the Capital One travel credit isn’t as easy to use as the travel credit with Chase, but is much easier to use than the American Express travel credit.\n\nThis also doesn’t tell the full story of the card’s value proposition, though:\n\n• The Venture X has by far the lowest annual fee of the three cards\n• The $300 annual travel credit is only one of the annual perks the card offers — the card also offers 10,000 anniversary Capital One bonus miles, which can be redeemed for $100 worth of travel, or can be transferred to airline & hotel partners at a ratio of up to 1:1\n• For savvy travelers, the $300 travel credit plus 10,000 bonus miles should be worth more than the card’s $395 annual fee, not even factoring in anything else\nThe Venture X also offers 10K bonus anniversary miles\n## Bottom line\n\nThe Capital One Venture X and Capital One Venture X Business are incredibly lucrative. The cards have a $395 annual fee, and one of the primary things that offsets that fee is the $300 annual travel credit, which can be applied toward virtually any purchase with Capital One Travel.\n\nWhile some people might find a slight hassle factor to using a portal, this really shouldn’t be that hard to maximize on a flight, hotel, or rental car. My strategy is to simply book a $300+ flight every year through the portal, and that gets me $300 back. There’s almost no opportunity cost, so I’d consider that to be pretty awesome.\n\n**To fellow Venture X cardmembers — what’s your strategy for using the $300 annual travel credit?**\n\nRead More\n\nMust-Read: A Yale Academic’s Bizarre Defense Of\n\nAmerican CEO Robert Isom",

In this post, I wanted to take a closer look at those three cards, and help anyone who might be trying to decide between these different products. Is there a clear winner?\n\nIn this post:\n\n## The three Capital One Venture Card products\n\nThere are three different “flavors” of the Capital One Venture, all going after a different consumer base:\n\n• The Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card has no annual fee\n• The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card has a $95 annual fee\n• The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card has a $395 annual fee\n\nWhich of these cards is the best value?

While not everyone is going to agree on the best strategy, let me share some general things to consider.\n\n### The cards aren’t mutually exclusive\n\nThe first thing to understand is that you could actually apply for multiple of these cards. The bonus on each version of the Venture Card is a one-time offer. However, if you’ve had the Capital One Venture Card in the past (or even if you still have it), you’d still be eligible for the bonus on the Capital One Venture X Card.\n\nTherefore deciding which card to apply for doesn’t have to be very high stakes.\nYou can earn the bonuses on multiple Venture products\n### You have the option of upgrading or downgrading cards\n\nCredit card issuers generally let you upgrade or downgrade cards within the same product family, as long as you’ve had a card for at least 12 months. This won’t always be possible, but more often than not it is. That means you could apply for one card in the Venture lineup, and then if you later decide that another card is a better fit for you, you can product change to that.\nYou should be able to upgrade or downgrade your card\n### Go after a big welcome bonus\n\nThere’s a significant difference in terms of the welcome bonuses here. The Capital One VentureOne Card offers a bonus of 20,000 miles, while both the Capital One Venture Card and Capital One Venture X Card offer a significantly larger bonus.\n\nCapital One miles can be redeemed for a minimum of one cent each toward a travel purchase, though personally, I value them at 1.7 cents each, for the ability to convert them into airline miles and hotel points. So there’s a difference of at least $550 between the value of just the points in these bonuses (75,000 miles vs. 20,000 miles), and by my valuation, there’s a difference of $935 between the value of the points.\n\nThat’s a reason to pick up one of the premium cards, and if you later decide it’s not a good fit for you, there should be the option to downgrade.\nRedeem Capital One miles toward the cost of travel purchases\n### The value of 1.25x miles vs. 2x miles",

So how should you account for the difference in value there?\n\n• At a valuation of 1.0 cents per mile, that’s a difference in return of 0.75% on spending\n• At a valuation of 1.7 cents per mile, that’s a difference of 1.275% on spending\n\nTo keep things simple, let’s compare the no annual fee Capital One VentureOne Card and $95 annual fee Capital One Venture Card, and how quickly you could recoup the annual fee. With the difference of 0.75 Capital One miles per dollar spent:\n\n• If you value miles at 1.0 cents each (based on the ability to redeem them as cash toward travel purchases), then you’d come out ahead with the Venture over the VentureOne if you spend at least $12,667 per year\n• If you value miles at 1.7 cents each (based on the ability to convert them into airline miles at a 1:1 ratio), then you’d come out ahead with the Venture over the VentureOne if you spend at least $7,451 per year\n\nThis doesn’t even factor in the other perks offered by the more premium versions of the card, like a TSA PreCheck or Global Entry credit, etc.\nRedeem Capital One miles for Singapore Airlines business class\n### Why the Capital One Venture X is the no-brainer\n\nI think most people can agree that it makes sense to apply for the Capital One Venture Card over the Capital One VentureOne Card, even if they ordinarily prefer cards without annual fees. The welcome bonus is much better, as is the return on spending. You should be able to downgrade the card after a year if you decide it doesn’t make sense to you.\n\nBut should you instead pay an extra $300 in annual fees and get the Capital One Venture X Card? Personally I think the math there potentially checks out as well:\n\n• You’ll get a $300 Capital One Travel portal credit, which you can use to book a $300 flight or hotel; that right there should recoup the difference on an ongoing basis\n• You’ll get a Priority Pass™ Select membership, offering you access to the biggest lounge network in the world, plus access to Plaza Premium Lounges\n• You’ll get access to Capital One Lounges and Capital One Landings, which are both growing networks\n• If you keep the card for a second year, you’ll also get 10,000 anniversary bonus miles\n\nAnd there are many, many other perks. The Capital One Venture X is really a premium credit card that makes sense even for people who don’t usually get premium credit cards. If you can get over the initial “sticker shock” of paying a $395 annual fee, you’ll quickly get outsized value from the card.\nGet a Priority Pass™ Select membership with the Venture X\n## Bottom line\n\nCapital One’s Venture lineup consists of the Capital One VentureOne Card, Capital One Venture Card, and Capital One Venture X Card. Each card has a unique value proposition:",

So you can easily break even without having to memorize a complicated coupon book of credits that you’d have to twist yourself into pretzels to use every month or quarter. And that’s before taking into account the card’s other perks, including airport lounge access, a generous welcome bonus and excellent ongoing rewards.\n\nAs an exhausted credit cards “optimizer” who had spent years poring over terms and conditions of far more complex (and costly) premium cards, I found the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card to be exactly what I was looking for in summer of 2024. At the time:\n\n• I needed to replace my home’s air conditioning unit, to the tune of more than $12,000.\n• We were planning an expensive trip the following year to New York City, where my daughter’s choir would be performing.\n\nI had an emergency fund to cover the A/C. But I figured if I was dropping that kind of coin, I might as well get something back for it in the form of travel rewards that could defray the cost of the NYC trip, not to mention some other journeys we’d been considering. By putting the A/C on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, I not only snagged a big welcome bonus almost immediately, but also locked in _future_ travel savings thanks to the card’s various credits.\n\nTo optimize the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, you’ll have to be comfortable booking travel through Capital One’s online portal. And as with other general-purpose travel cards, don’t expect brand-specific perks, like free checked bags or an annual free hotel night. But if practicality and ease of use are priorities, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is unbeatable at its price.\n\n### **Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card: Basics**\n\n**Card type:** Travel.\n\n**Annual fee:** $395 (see rates and fees).\n\n**Sign-up bonus:** Earn 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening, equal to $750 in travel.\n\n**Rewards:**\n\n• 2 miles per dollar spent on purchases.\n• 5 miles per dollar on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel.\n• 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.\n\n**Options for redeeming miles:**\n\n• Redeem for statement credit against travel purchases.\n• Use to book travel through Capital One.\n• Transfer to more than 15 partner airline and hotel programs. Per-mile value depends on the transfer partner and how you redeem the transferred miles.\n• Redeem for gift cards.\n\n**How much are Capital One miles worth?** NerdWallet's analysis of Capital One miles determines that they are worth:\n\n• Exactly 1 cent apiece when redeemed for statement credit or used to book travel through Capital One.\n• An average of 1.6 cents apiece when transferred to partner programs and redeemed there.\n• Between 0.8 and 1 cent apiece when redeemed for gift cards.\n\n**Interest rate:** The ongoing APR is 19.49%-28.49% Variable APR.\n\n**Foreign transaction fees:** None.\n\n**Credit required:** Excellent.\n\n**Other benefits:**",

This card delivers, as long as you’re willing to use Capital One’s online travel-booking portal. You get:\n\n• 5 miles per dollar on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel.\n• 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.\n\nUnlike some of its competitors, this card rewards you handsomely for everyday spending, too. It earns 2 miles per dollar spent on purchases outside the bonus areas, where most people's spending typically occurs. Competing cards typically offer only 1 point or mile per dollar for such spending.\n\nRemember that A/C I had to replace? That purchase alone netted me 24,000 miles — worth at least $240 toward my New York City trip.\n\n**» MORE:**Best credit cards for home improvement\n\n### **Generous welcome bonus**\n\nWelcome offers can change over time, especially with travel credit cards. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card has an excellent one: Earn 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening, equal to $750 in travel.\n\n**» MORE:** Best credit card bonus offers\n\n### **Airport lounge access**",

    "content": "**» MORE:** Best credit card bonus offers\n\n### **Airport lounge access**\n\nAccording to the issuer's website, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card gives access to more than 1,300 Priority Pass lounges. This is a somewhat common offering on travel cards in this class. But what sets the card apart is that it also offers full access to the Capital One's nascent but growing lounge network. As of December 2025, according to Capital One Travel, Capital One-branded lounges and \"landings\" were open at:\n\n• Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n• Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C.\n• Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n• Denver International Airport.\n• Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas.\n• John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. (A location is planned for LaGuardia, too.)\n\nI’ll be honest: Airport lounge access doesn’t do much for me. My home airport is small and has only one Priority Pass lounge, and I don’t need the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card to access it; any number of travel credit cards could get me in. More to the point, I’m not sure I even want to anymore? Like most other Priority Pass lounges, mine is cramped and crowded and low on amenities. The line for the bathroom is interminable, and while snagging a “free” soda or beer is nice, oddly there’s no bottled water in sight.\n\nEven more exclusive lounges can, in my experience, be underwhelming. There’s sometimes a line to get in the line, and that’s assuming you can even find it. Me, I’d been looking forward to sampling the new Capital One lounge at JFK when we flew home from our NYC trip — but because we were flying JetBlue, our terminal wasn’t anywhere near the lounge and would have required going back through security to access it. No thanks.\n\nSo personally, this benefit isn’t worth much to me. But if you're a lounge lover, NerdWallet's travel rewards experts report that Capital One’s are nice! Maybe one day I'll find out for myself.\n\n### **Annual perks**\n\nCentral to the value of the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card are its annual credits, which have substantial dollar value.\n\n• Up to $300 annual credit for bookings made through Capital One Travel.\n• 10,000 bonus miles every account anniversary (equal to $100 toward travel). The first batch of miles comes when you renew after one year of card membership.\n\nThose benefits alone, which renew each year, make up for the annual fee. That assumes you’ll use the Capital One Travel online booking service — and I’ve been more than happy to do so.\n\nIn February 2025, I used my $300 credit toward flights for my wife and me to Cancun, to celebrate our 15-year anniversary.\n\nAnd in summer 2026, I’ll be using these credits toward a family trip to England. They’ll be enough to almost fully cover a four-night stay at a small inn, nestled in a rustic town with no major hotel chains. In my mind, that’s a perfect use case for an issuer's travel portal.\n\n### **Flexible redemption options**\n\nCapital One's rewards program gives you several ways to use your miles for travel:",

    "content": "### **Flexible redemption options**\n\nCapital One's rewards program gives you several ways to use your miles for travel:\n\n• **Redeem rewards as a statement credit.** Book travel however you want, then redeem miles for statement credit for some or all of the cost. Miles are worth 1 cent each when redeemed like this, according to NerdWallet valuations, with no minimum redemption amount required. Any expense that Capital One considers \"travel\" is eligible, including not only flights and hotel stays, but \"rail lines, car rental agencies, limousine services, bus lines, cruise lines, taxi cabs, travel agents and time shares,\" according to the Capital One website.\n• **Book through the issuer's travel center.** This online portal offers flights, hotels, rental cars and vacation packages. You can pay upfront with your miles, at a rate of 1 cent per mile, according to NerdWallet valuations.\n• **Transfer miles to partners.** Capital One lets you transfer your miles to the loyalty programs of a number of airline and hotel partners. We calculate that miles are worth an average of 1.6 cents apiece when used this way.\n\nFull list of Capital One transfer partners\n\n**Airlines**\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n**Hotels**\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nMiles have no blackout dates and never expire.\n\nFor me — and, remember, I’m trying to keep things simple — using my rewards to book directly through Capital One’s travel portal has been the most seamless redemption option, especially since that’s also how you have to use the annual $300 travel credit.\n\nI know I could probably squeeze more value from my points by transferring them to a Capital One partner, but that actually happens to be one of the few drawbacks of this card, in my opinion. More on that later.\n\n### **Simplicity**\n\n“Simple” and “premium travel credit card” aren't concepts that usually go together, since the typical card in that category is wildly complicated. But relatively speaking, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is easier to understand than, say, the American Express Platinum Card®. That card has a dizzying array of benefits, many of which aren’t super-useful to everybody or take an inordinate amount of effort to use.\n\nBy contrast, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card at its core retains the simplicity of the original Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card by offering a flat rewards rate on all spending and lets you redeem rewards to pay for any travel expense.\n\nIt layers on airport lounge access and more rewards if you use the Capital One Travel portal.\n\nThe point is that someone willing to endure only modest hassle from their travel credit card can enjoy and benefit from the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. That same person might be frustrated by complex competing travel credit cards.\n\n### **Travel-friendly perks**\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card offers additional benefits that frequent travelers will enjoy.

Some come because it's a top-tier Visa Infinite card.\n\n• **Complimentary Hertz President’s Circle status.** This is the top status tier at Hertz. According to Hertz, customers with this status can get confirmed one-car-class upgrades, 50% bonus on Gold Plus Rewards points on qualified rentals, free additional driver, expedited pickup and e-return, and more. The status is typically reserved for customers who have 20 or more rentals in a year or spend $4,000.\n• **Cell phone protection.**\n• **Travel protections.** These include auto rental collision damage waiver, trip cancellation and interruption, and trip delay reimbursement.\n• **No foreign transaction fees.** Standard on travel credit cards and useful for overseas purchases.\n• **Trusted traveler application credit.**A statement credit of up to $120 for the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck. The credit is available once every four years.\n\n(Note: Benefits may change over time.)\n\nThat TSA PreCheck/Global Entry application credit is a common perk among travel cards, but it’s also one I’ve historically undervalued, simply because until recently, my home airport did not offer Global Entry appointments. But that changed in 2025, and I figured that since I had an upcoming trip to England, it was time to take the plunge and apply. Thanks to the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, the $120 application fee was reimbursed.\n\n**» MORE:** Capital One credit cards mobile app review\n\n#### MORE NERDY PERSPECTIVES\n\nThis is one of those cards with a high annual fee — but it's an annual fee that's relatively easy to justify. The annual travel credit is easy to use. Other benefits like lounge access are icing on the cake — and decadent icing at that. Plus, the transfer partners can make points ultra-valuable if you're willing to put in the effort to snag a great transfer redemption. Even if you don't go the transfer partner route and just use your points to book travel through Capital One, take solace in knowing that the bank's travel portal is better designed than similar portals from other competitors.\n\nwriter/spokesperson, travel rewards\n\nVenture X is my newest premium travel card, and I plan to make it my wallet's workhorse! Within a week of receiving the card, I had already used the annual travel credit for a trip to visit my parents. Between that travel credit, a massive sign-up bonus, lounge access and ability to transfer miles to partners for outsized value, I plan to keep the Venture X for years to come. The card basically pays me to hold it.\n\nwriter, travel rewards\n\nI love the flexibility and simplicity. I recently used the card’s travel credit to book a flight to see a friend in Florida, and I used some of my miles for tourist activities like kayaking, water taxis and more. I’m also accumulating miles toward the next vacation without having to worry about expiration dates.\n\nwriter, credit cards\n\nI'm the authorized user on my husband's card, and I love that I get to piggyback on the perks. I've used this card to gain access to lots of airport lounges. The annual fee is high, but with the travel credit, it's relatively easy to more than offset that fee each year. To me, this is a great blend of high-end benefits and extreme practicality.\n\nwriter/spokesperson, credit cards\n\n## Drawbacks and Considerations\n\n### **Annual fee**",

    "content": "writer/spokesperson, credit cards\n\n## Drawbacks and Considerations\n\n### **Annual fee**\n\nWith annual fees, it’s all relative. A yearly fee of $395 is substantial, but other luxury travel credit cards have similar or even significantly higher fees. For example:\n\n• **Chase Sapphire Reserve®:** $795.\n• **American Express Platinum Card®:** $895.\n\nStill, if a big annual fee bothers you, but you like aspects of the card, consider the original Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. (See a comparison below.)\n\nOutside the Capital One family, look at the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card with an annual fee of $95. It’s versatile and valuable as a travel credit card.\n\n### **Value tied to booking portal**\n\nCapital One Travel, the issuer’s online travel-booking site, has nice features, including predictive pricing models and tools to help customers get the best deals — including proactively comparing hotel rates against Expedia, Orbitz and other travel booking sites. It offers access to thousands of flights, hotels and rental cars, and features free price-drop protection, 24/7 alerts and the option to freeze a price and come back 14 days later to book it.\n\nBut this card’s value is so tied to that booking portal that it diminishes one of the main selling points of the Venture family of cards: flexibility.\n\nIf for some reason you won’t use Capital One Travel for booking, the bonus rewards for spending on this card as well as the huge $300 travel credit are worth nothing to you. The card’s value proposition quickly shrinks. Many travelers prefer to book directly with hotels, for example, which adds to their elite status with a particular hotel chain or allows them to use status benefits they already have. Booking through a travel portal can negate those elite benefits.\n\nBy comparison, the competing Chase Sapphire Reserve® also links the value of its rewards to its travel portal. Chase Ultimate Rewards® points can be worth more than the standard 1 cent per point if used to book travel there. But the Chase card's $300 annual credit is good toward travel booked anywhere, not just in Chase's travel portal, and it can be used for a broader range of travel purchases, including taxi rides, campground fees and train fares.\n\nThe 10,000-point anniversary bonus on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is more comparable to the Chase card's $300 credit. That bonus can be used more flexibly for travel, although it is worth only $100.\n\nGranted, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® has a higher annual fee of $795.\n\n### **Lack of familiar transfer partners**\n\nFor travelers who like to squeeze every last drop of value out of loyalty programs, the growing roster of transfer partners on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is appealing. You can now transfer your Venture miles to more than a dozen airline partners — but JetBlue is the only domestic carrier. While transferring miles to foreign airline carriers can bring outsize value for your miles, it may be overwhelming for those just beginning with transfers.\n\nHeck, it's overwhelming for me, and I'm not exactly a novice. I also have travel credit cards with Chase and American Express, and I've transferred points to those issuers' partners many times. But Chase and AmEx boast major U.S. carriers and companies as partners, names that are much more familiar to the average traveler.\n\nBut hey, if you have the time and inclination to study up on travel routes and mileage charts for EVA, Finnair, or TAP Air Portugal? Knock yourself out. I’m sure there are sweet spots for outsize value there, but I have other cards for that.",

Quantitative features are those that boil down to dollars and cents, such as fees, interest rates, rewards (including earning rates and redemption values) and the cash value of benefits and perks. Qualitative factors are those that affect how easy or difficult it is for a typical cardholder to get good value from the card. They include such things as the ease of application, simplicity of the rewards structure, the likelihood of using certain features, and whether a card is well-suited to everyday use or is best reserved for specific purchases. Our star ratings serve as a general gauge of how each card compares with others in its class, but star ratings are intended to be just one consideration when a consumer is choosing a credit card.

    "content": "## » This offer has expired\n\nThe limited-time offer described in this article ended in January 2026, so this page is out of date. See our review of the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card for the current offer.\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is beefing up its welcome bonus for new cardholders just in time for new year's travel resolutions. If your budget is in line with the high spending requirement, the latest offer can provide a lot of value toward your next trip.\n\nHere’s what to expect.\n\n## The new sign-up offer\n\nNew cardholders are eligible to earn this sign-up offer: Earn 100,000 bonus miles once you spend $10,000 on purchases in the first 6 months from account opening - equal to $1,000 in travel.\n\nThis is significantly higher than the previous bonus: 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening, equal to $750 in travel. You’ll have to spend more than double the amount to earn it, but you’ll have twice as much time to do so.\n\nMiles can be redeemed for statement credit against travel purchases, for travel bookings through Capital One, as transfers to airline or hotel partners, and for gift cards, to name a few options. Each mile is worth 1 cent apiece when redeemed for statement credit or bookings through Capital One, and potentially more when you transfer and redeem them through partners. In short, the bonus could cover a sizable chunk of your vacation costs.\n\nAside from the new bonus, the card offers ongoing perks and rewards that can help offset the cost of the $395 annual fee.\n\n### Ongoing rewards\n\n• 2 miles per $1 spent on purchases.\n• 5 miles per $1 spent on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel.\n• 10 miles per $1 on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.\n\n### Perks\n\n• Up to $300 annual credit for bookings made through Capital One Travel.\n• 10,000 bonus miles every account anniversary (equal to $100 toward travel).\n• Unlimited access to Capital One Lounges and more than 1,300 lounges through the Capital One Partner Network.\n• Complimentary Hertz President’s Circle status. (Car upgrades, expedited pickup and more.)\n• Credit of up to $120 for the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck when you pay with the card.\n• Extra perks when you book a hotel stay through Capital One's Premier Collection, like a $100 experience credit, daily breakfast for two people and complimentary WiFi.\n• Cell phone protection, shopping protections and travel protections.*\n\nFor Capital One products listed on this page, some of the benefits may be provided by Visa® or Mastercard® and may vary by product. See the respective Guide to Benefits for details, as terms and exclusions apply.\n\nAbout the author\n\nMelissa Lambarena\n\nMelissa is a credit cards writer at NerdWallet.

    "content": "SOME CARD INFO MAY BE OUTDATED\nThis page includes information about these cards, currently unavailable on NerdWallet. The information has been collected by NerdWallet and has not been provided or reviewed by the card issuer.\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is the bank's first foray into the premium travel card space, and it delivers with high-end lounge access, travel credits and transfer partners.\n\nIt comes with a $395 annual fee, which is hundreds of dollars less than many competitors. But it still has common benefits you've probably come to expect from top-tier travel cards. Think: lounge access, statement credits for travel, and TSA PreCheck or Global Entry reimbursement.\n\nStill, can the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card compete with the likes of the American Express Platinum Card® and the Chase Sapphire Reserve®? Is the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card worth its $395 annual fee?\n\nWe’ll cover the card’s benefits and how it stacks up against cards in a similar price range.\n\n## Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card benefits\n\nNerdWallet rating How is this rating determined?\n\nNerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula takes into account the type of card being reviewed (such as cash back, travel or balance transfer) and the card's rates, fees, rewards and other features.\n\nRead Review\n\n### Sign-up bonus\n\nEarn 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening, equal to $750 in travel.\n\nThis isn’t the highest sign-up bonus we’ve ever seen on a travel card, but it’s respectable. The bonus alone makes the card easy to justify in the first year of being a cardholder, but you’ll want to think about the ongoing benefits as well.\n\n### Rewards rate (value depends on your spending habits)\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card has a similar miles-earning scheme to the other cards in the Venture family. It earns 2 miles per $1 spent on every purchase. That's higher than the earning rates outside of bonus categories on cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve® and the American Express Platinum Card®. Terms apply.\n\nIf you book travel through Capital One Travel with cash, you could earn even more miles:\n\n• 10x miles on hotels and rental cars.\n• 5x miles on flights.\n\n🤓 Nerdy Tip\nCapital One Venture cards earn miles, but those miles don’t actually have to be used to book flights. They're akin to points that can be redeemed for hotels, rental cars and flights, or transferred to airline or hotel partners.\n\n### TSA PreCheck/Global Entry statement credit (up to $120)\n\nOne of the best features of the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card makes a reappearance on this card. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card will give you an up-to-$120 statement credit if you use the card to pay for your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.\n\n» Learn more: What you need to know about Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit cards\n\nSubscribe to our free TravelNerd newsletter for inspiration, tips and money-saving strategies, delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nEmail address\n\nSign up NOW\n\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\n### Lounge access (value varies based on your usage)\n\nHere’s where we start getting into some premium benefits. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card gives you unlimited access to Priority Pass and Capital One airport lounges.",

    "content": "### Lounge access (value varies based on your usage)\n\nHere’s where we start getting into some premium benefits. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card gives you unlimited access to Priority Pass and Capital One airport lounges.\n\nThroughout the Capital One lounge at the Las Vegas airport, you'll find table seating, booths and armchairs. (Photo by Meghan Coyle)\n\nHowever, cardholders cannot bring guests into Capital One lounges for free unless they spend $75,000 on their card in a calendar year. The guest fee is $45 per adult or $25 per child (ages 2 to 17). There is no complimentary guest access for Priority Pass lounges, even if they hit that spending threshold.\n\nAuthorized users do not get complimentary lounge access either, although there is the option to pay a $125 annual lounge access fee per additional cardholder.\n\nThe Capital One lounges are some of the best airport lounges in the U.S. They are fairly new, as the first one opened in late 2021 in the Dallas-Forth Worth airport, so you can expect modern design, excellent food served in small plates, and some thoughtful amenities for customers.\n\nFor example, some Capital One lounges locations have a grab-and-go section for people who are just stopping to get a snack or coffee before their next flight. This section usually has a refrigerator stocked with salads, sandwiches, wraps, desserts and boxed water to go.\n\nThe grab-and-go section. (Photo by Meghan Coyle)\n\nSome unique amenities at Capital One lounges include a yoga and cycling room complete with Peloton bikes and meditation rooms with napping pods.\n\nA Peloton room overlooks the airfield at the DFW Capital One lounge. (Photo by Sally French)\n\nDay passes to Capital One's lounges cost $90, although certain cardholders and their guests are entitled to discounts.\n\n» Learn more: How to maximize the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card\n\n### Anniversary bonus (worth $100)\n\nEvery year you renew the card, you’ll get a bonus of 10,000 miles deposited into your account. This perk might help you justify the annual fee because it effectively wipes out $100 of the $395 each year.\n\n» Learn more: 5 top credit cards with anniversary bonuses\n\n### Statement credit for bookings made on Capital One Travel (up to $300)\n\nAlong with the anniversary bonus, the statement credit for Capital One Travel bookings could offset the rest of the annual fee. Each year, you can get statement credits for up to $300 worth of travel booked with Capital One.\n\nThis benefit is on par with the $300 annual travel credit on the Chase Sapphire Reserve®. The only difference is that statement credits on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card apply only to bookings made through the Capital One Travel portal, while the Chase Sapphire Reserve®’s credit applies to almost any travel charged to the card.\n\n» Learn more: Guide to the Capital One Travel portal\n\n### Transfer partners\n\nCapital One miles are actually more flexible than you might think.

    "content": "## Why the card’s annual fee is actually a good deal\n\nNotably, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card has most everything you would expect from a premium travel credit card, and the lowest annual fee among the bunch.\n\nMost other premium travel cards have significantly higher annual fees, so $395 is a good value. It also has enough annual benefits ($300 for Capital One Travel bookings and $100 worth of anniversary bonus points) to completely offset the annual fee fairly easily every single year.\n\nThe catch is that you’ll have to do some travel booking through the Capital One Travel portal to maximize the statement credits and number of miles you’ll earn. The portal might limit your choices a bit.\n\nThe transfer partners are also a good choice for redemptions, but the lack of hotel partners and domestic airlines may make this card less appealing to novice points travelers.\n\nFor people willing to take a chance on a growing travel rewards program, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is a good way to get into the premium travel credit card space at a lower price point.\n\nTo view rates and fees of the American Express Platinum Card®, see this page.\n\n### How to maximize your rewards\n\nYou want a travel credit card that prioritizes what’s important to you.

    "content": "SOME CARD INFO MAY BE OUTDATED\nThis page includes information about these cards, currently unavailable on NerdWallet. The information has been collected by NerdWallet and has not been provided or reviewed by the card issuer.\n\nWhen it launched, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card quickly gained popularity for its generous lounge access policies. But starting in 2026, many of those benefits are changing or going away.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2026, authorized users will lose their complimentary airport lounge access. That’s a major shift for the premium travel rewards credit card, which boasted of its ability to share benefits with authorized users when it first launched in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, cardholders of the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card and the Capital One Venture X Business will no longer be able to bring guests for free into a Capital One Lounge or Landing (the issuer's sit-down restaurant concept) without meeting a $75,000 spending requirement each calendar year.\n\nCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card holders will also lose complimentary access for guests to lounges in the Priority Pass network. Capital One Venture X Business cardholders will not be affected and will still be able to bring two guests to Priority Pass lounges.\n\nSubscribe to our free TravelNerd newsletter for inspiration, tips and money-saving strategies, delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nEmail address\n\nSign up NOW\n\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\n“As airport lounges continue to grow in popularity across the industry, we’ve seen our customers increasingly encounter wait times to enter them,” Capital One said in a statement explaining the changes.\n\nThese card updates mirror steps that American Express has taken to limit the number of people in its Centurion lounges.\n\n## How do these lounge access changes affect me?\n\n### If you travel with others …\n\nStarting Feb. 1, 2026, you’ll no longer be able to use the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card to bring guests to lounges for free.\n\nTo regain free guest access for Capital One Lounges and Landings, you’ll need to spend at least $75,000 on your card in one calendar year. After that, you’ll be able to bring in two guests at no charge to Capital One Lounges through the following calendar year. For visits to Capital One Landings, you’ll be limited to one guest. (Landings are sit-down restaurants, not traditional lounges.)\n\nCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card holders will also lose complimentary access for guests to lounges in the Priority Pass network.\n\n### If you have (or are) an authorized user…\n\nWhile primary cardholders on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card will still be able to add or keep authorized users for free, those additional cardholders won’t get complimentary lounge access (even if they are an account manager). Instead, you’ll need to pay an annual lounge access fee of $125 for each additional cardholder. This will grant them access to Capital One Lounges, Capital One Landings and Priority Pass lounges.\n\nIf you currently have additional cardholders on your account, talk to them and figure out what the right approach is. Your authorized user may be willing to pay you $125 to cover the fee, or they may decide to get a Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card (or another travel card) of their own.\n\n» Learn more: The best credit cards for airport lounge access\n\n### If you have the Capital One Venture X Business…",

    "content": "» Learn more: The best credit cards for airport lounge access\n\n### If you have the Capital One Venture X Business…\n\nStarting Feb. 1, 2026, you will no longer be able to bring guests in for free to Capital One Lounges and Landings, unless you spend $75,000 on your card in a calendar year. If you hit that spending requirement, the guest policy is the same as before: two for Lounges and one for Landings. You’ll still be able to bring two guests for free into Priority Pass lounges once the new rules go into effect.\n\nOn the Capital One Venture X Business, up to four additional cardholders can receive lounge access at an annual fee of $125 per person. They will get their own Priority Pass memberships and be able to bring two guests for free. Previously, authorized users did not get any complimentary lounge access.\n\n### If you’re willing to pay for guests…\n\nCapital One is lowering its pricing for minors at its locations for both Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card and Capital One Venture X Business holders.\n\nIf you want to bring in additional guests beyond those included for free, you’ll continue to pay a discounted rate of $45 per adult guest per visit. (The standard rate is $90 per visit.)\n\nEffective immediately, Capital One will lower the rate for each guest 17 and under to $25. Children under 2 can enter for free.\n\nAdditional guests for Priority Pass lounges are $35 each.\n\n## Is the Venture X still worth it?\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card has always stood out for its generous lounge access policies for authorized users as well as guests, and unfortunately, I'm not surprised by the changes. It was only a matter of time before Capital One followed in the footsteps of American Express and Chase, which require an additional fee for authorized users each year for their own flagship travel credit cards.\n\nUnless you're a solo traveler, these changes are a major blow to the value proposition of the card, and it might be time to reconsider.\n\nFor one thing, Capital One does not have that many locations to begin with. Meanwhile, American Express and Chase partner with Delta Air Lines and Air Canada, respectively, to offer cardholders even more lounge access when flying with those airline partners — something that Capital One also lacks.\n\nBut at $395 a year, Capital One's premium travel card still offers compelling value for travelers — even with the reduced lounge access benefits. The card comes with a $300 annual travel credit that can be used in Capital One’s travel portal, as well as 10,000 bonus miles on each account anniversary. Plus, it earns 2 miles per $1 on every purchase. That’s solid, especially if you only want one card in your wallet and don’t enjoy figuring out which one offers the best rewards for each purchase.\n\nMiles can be redeemed at 1 cent per mile in the travel portal or transferred to one of Capital One’s hotel or airline partners. Compared to other premium travel cards, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is still relatively easy to use. Capital One hasn’t adopted American Express' “coupon book” model, where the issuer justifies a sky-high annual fee with onerous credits that are difficult to use and keep track of.\n\nAs long as you use the annual travel credit and bonus miles, that helps recoup the cost of the entire fee.\n\n» Learn more: The guide to Capital One transfer partners\n\n## Venture X alternative: Chase Sapphire Reserve",

    "content": "Capital One offers multiple versions of its Venture-branded credit card, and you could be forgiven for mixing them up thanks to these similar-sounding names:\n\n• The Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card - Miles Boost ($0 annual fee — see rates and fees).\n• The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card ($95 annual fee — see rates and fees ).\n• The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card ($395 annual fee — see rates and fees).\n\nAll three cards share the same basic DNA: Your purchases earn a flat rewards rate, and you can use your earned miles to book travel or redeem for travel statement credit at a rate of 1 cent per mile. You can also transfer your miles to a number of airline partners. None of the cards charges a foreign transaction fee. Given that, it's tempting to want to give an edge to the card without an annual fee.\n\n### ★ LIMITED TIME OFFER\n\nFor a limited time, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is offering new cardholders an especially rich bonus. The issuer describes it this way: \"LIMITED-TIME OFFER: Enjoy $250 to use on Capital One Travel in your first cardholder year, plus earn 75,000 bonus miles once you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening - that’s equal to $1,000 in travel. \" Get the full details here or read our review and apply here.\n\nBut in most respects, the VentureOne is the least valuable card of the bunch. If you charge at least $1,056 per month, the elevated rewards rates from the Venture or the Venture X both easily outshine the VentureOne, and that's before taking into account the richer bonuses and perks on those two more expensive cards.\n\nIn fact, for many travelers, the highest-fee card may emerge the victor, even for those who are usually averse to fees.\n\nHere’s how to decide which Venture card is right for you.\n\n» MORE: NerdWallet’s best travel credit cards\n\nHow the cards compare\n\nCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card\n\nNerdWallet Rating\nNerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Primary cardholders will still have full access to lounges. But the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card and Capital One Venture X Business will no longer have complimentary guest access at Capital One Lounges or Capital One Landings. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card will also lose guest access at Priority Pass lounges. Authorized users will also lose complimentary guest access to all lounges.\n\n## Why the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card comes out ahead\n\n### Travel credits\n\nThough the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card carries a premium $395 fee, it also comes with travel credits that can offset that fee. You’ll get up to a $300 credit each year toward travel booked through the Capital One Travel portal.\n\n### Better bonuses\n\nNew cardholders will earn the most Venture miles off the bat with the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card’s sign-up bonus: Earn 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening, equal to $750 in travel.\n\nBeyond that, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card offers a 10,000-mile anniversary bonus when you renew your card. That’s worth $100 toward travel (or even more if you strategically transfer to travel partners). Neither of the other cards offers an anniversary bonus.\n\n» SEE: Best credit card bonuses for new cardholders\n\n### Lounge perks",

    "content": "» SEE: Best credit card bonuses for new cardholders\n\n### Lounge perks\n\nIf you fly a few times a year, chances are you’ll transit through an airport with a Priority Pass lounge. Holders of the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card get access to the more than 1,300 Priority Pass lounges.\n\n## Why some travelers might choose the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card\n\nWhile $300 in annual credits is appealing to many travelers, the catch is that you have to book the travel through the Capital One Travel portal. While robust, the portal may not include all the travel you’d like to book. And if you have elite status with a travel program, you may not be entitled to all the perks you’d enjoy if you booked directly or to earn any points from the booking.\n\nAnother factor to consider: When you book travel through a third party like a travel portal, you introduce another party into the reservation. If you need to change or cancel the reservation, it can be more of a headache than if you’d booked directly.\n\nIf you don’t want to book some travel through the Capital One Travel portal, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card won’t be worth it.\n\n» MORE: How to make the most of your Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card\n\n## Who might prefer the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card - Miles Boost\n\n### No annual fee\n\nThis is the only area where the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card - Miles Boost (see rates and fees) wins out over its siblings. However, if an annual fee is a dealbreaker for you, there are other travel credit cards with no annual fee to choose from that have higher ongoing rewards rates.\n\nThe Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card - Miles Boost earns 5 miles per dollar on Capital One Travel hotel, vacation rental and rental car bookings, but its base rewards rate is only 1.25 miles per dollar. With so many no-fee cards earning at least 1.5% back, it can be hard to settle for less.\n\nIf you really can’t stomach an annual fee, another card may be a better fit. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, for example, offers 2% cash back on all purchases with a $0 annual fee.\n\n» READ: Is paying an annual fee for a credit card worth it?\n\n## Which card should you get?\n\nIf you’re looking for a travel credit card with an easy-to-understand rewards program and you spend enough per month to offset the annual fee in rewards, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card emerges as the clear winner. The $300 annual credit for travel booked through Capital One Travel and the 10,000 anniversary points outweigh the card’s annual fee, plus it offers valuable travel perks to boot.\n\nIf booking through a travel portal isn’t for you, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a good bet. Or, see here for our comprehensive list of NerdWallet's best credit cards.\n\nMore from Capital One:\n\nHertz President's Club status: Upon enrollment, accessible through the Capital One website or mobile app, eligible cardholders will remain at that status level through the duration of the offer. Please note, enrolling through the normal Hertz Gold Plus Rewards enrollment process (e.g. at Hertz.com) will not automatically detect a cardholder as being eligible for the program and cardholders will not be automatically upgraded to the applicable status tier.

    "content": "**Update 10/29/25:** The Capital One media team reached out to clarify the new policy:\n\n_Bonus offers—such as early spend, referral bonuses, and limited-time offers—are based on eligibility and subject to change. As of today, this is the policy:_\n\n• • _Venture X: Customers are not eligible for the Venture X bonus if they have earned the Venture X bonus within the last 48 months_\n• _Venture: Customers are not eligible for the Venture bonus if they have earned the Venture X bonus or the Venture bonus within the last 48 months_\n• _VentureOne: Customers are not eligible for the VentureOne bonus if they have earned the Venture X, Venture, or VentureOne bonus within the last 48 months_\n\nBasically, you can get bonuses in upward mobility fashion but not downward (VentureOne $0 fee –> Venture $95 fee –> Venture X $395 annual fee). There was (and maybe still is) conflicting terms in the Venture X language which was the basis for our original post, but the policy above is the official word and it kinda makes sense too.\n\n**Original Post 10/26/25:**\n\nSince 2023, Capital One has a rule that you can only get a signup bonus once every 48 months. They’ve now tweaked the language of the terms to combine the Venture X and Venture cards into one family for the 48 month wait:\n\n_You are not eligible for this product if you have received a new cardmember bonus for the Capital One Venture card or the Capital One Venture X card in the past 48 months._\n\nIt’s not clear if this language is yet being enforced, but worth keeping in mind.\n\nHat tip to CobaltSunsets",

Authorized users are free and also get access to perks like Priority Pass, Capital One Lounges and more.

    "content": "You can get even more value by transferring Capital One Miles to airline miles since award tickets often yield better value than 1c per mile. The ability to earn the equivalent of 2 airline miles per dollar spent everywhere is _excellent_.\n\nIt is worth noting that Capital One is known to pull from all three credit bureaus for new applications, resulting in hard inquiries on all of them. Anecdotally, some have reported being approved with a single report frozen.\n\n### Are you eligible?\n\nCapital One allows at most 2 Capital One consumer cards and you must wait six months before applying for another card.\n\nExisting or previous cardholders are not eligible if they have received a new cardmember bonus for a Venture X card within the last 48 months.\n\nHowever, beyond those rules, Capital One also tends to be less likely to approve those who have opened many credit cards with other issuers. There is no known rule as to how many is too many, but those who regularly open rewards credit cards are likely to have difficulty being approved.\n\n### How to apply\n\nYou can find the current best welcome bonus offer and application link at the top of this page: Capital One® Venture X Rewards Credit Card.\n\n### Application status\n\nAfter you apply, call (800) 903-9177 or (877) 277-5901 to check your application status.\n\n### Reconsideration\n\nIf your application is denied, we recommend calling for reconsideration (800) 625-7866. It’s surprising how often denials can be changed to approvals just by asking, though note that Capital One is unlikely to approve those with many open credit cards.\n\n## Capital One Venture X Credit Card Perks\n\n### Capital One “Miles”\n\nCapital One calls its rewards currency “miles”, though really it is like other transferable currencies in that it offers the ability to redeem towards travel or to transfer to airline miles as follows:\n\n• **Redeem Points $0.01 each toward travel**: Points are worth 1 cent each toward travel and can be used to reimburse a broad range of travel purchases (including flights, lodging, ride shares, cruises, and more) within 90 days of purchase.\n• **Transfer Points to Partners:**Points can be transferred to a number of airline and hotel loyalty programs. It’s possible to get much better than 1 cent per “mile” value via high value airline or hotel awards. See Capital One Transfer Partners for details.\n\n### Anniversary Bonus\n\n• Receive 10,000 bonus miles each year starting at first cardholder anniversary.\n\n### Travel Benefits\n\n• **Annual $300 Travel Credit**: Venture X cardholders get a $300 credit towards travel booked through Capital One Travel.\n• **Premier Collection Access:**Capital One’s “premium hotel collection. When booking through Capital One, get $100 experience credit, daily breakfast for two and other premium benefits (see terms and properties here).\n• **Global Entry/Pre Check Credit**: Receive up to $100 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck® when you use your Venture X card. Get one statement credit every four years.\n\n### Lounge Access\n\n**Note**: From February 1, 2026, additional cardholders on Capital One Venture X cards will lose lounge access. To regain access, you’ll have to pay an annual lounge access fee of $125. That will reenable access to Capital One Lounges, Capital One Landings and Priority Pass lounges.\n\nUntil February 1, 2026, the following policy applies:\n\n• **Priority Pass**: Complimentary Priority Pass membership (Lounges only) with up to two guests.\n• **Capital One Lounges**: Cardholders and authorized users get complimentary access to a Capital One Lounges, including the cardholder and up to two guests.",

However, if you and eligible additional cardholders spend $75,000 in a calendar year, you’ll be able to bring two complimentary guests in to Capital One Lounges and one complimentary guest to Capital One Landings.

Here’s the description directly from Capital One: “Rent an eligible vehicle with your credit card and you can be covered for damage due to collision or theft.”\n• **Trip Delay Insurance**: If you pay for at least a portion of your airfare with a Venture X Card, can get up to $500 if your travel is delayed by six or more hours or forces you into an overnight stay. Cardholder, spouse, and dependent children under 22 years old are covered.\n\n### Cell Phone Insurance (applies to authorized users)\n\n• If you pay your cell phone bill with your Capital One Venture X card, you’re insured if your cell phone is stolen or damaged.\n\n• You must have paid with your card in the billing cycle before the month the incident occurs.\n• Cell phone coverage applies to all lines listed on the account.\n• There is a $50 deductible per claim.\n• Maximum of two claims per year.\n\n### Purchase Protection (applies to authorized users)\n\n• **Extended Warranty:**“Doubles the time period of the original manufacturer’s written U.S. repair warranty up to one (1) additional year on eligible warranties of three (3) years or less for items purchased entirely with your eligible Visa Signature card.”\n\n## Capital One® Venture X Credit Card Earn Points\n\n### Welcome Bonus\n\nThis card earns Capital One “miles”.

This is because if you redeem for cash back, whether as a statement credit or via check, you’ll only receive half the value of travel redemptions: just 0.5 cents per “mile”. If you are looking for cash back rewards, there are much better options on the market.\n\n### Travel\n\n#### Redeem miles for paid travel: 1 cent per mile\nCapital One miles can be redeemed for paid travel at a rate of 1 cent per mile. Travel purchases can be reimbursed by redeeming miles within 90 days of purchase. Note that Capital One keeps a fairly broad definition of travel, with things like flights, hotels, Airbnb, ride shares, cruises, and more qualifying. There is no minimum redemption if you are covering the charge completely with your miles. If you are redeeming for a partial credit toward a travel purchase, the minimum is 2,500 miles. Also keep in mind that Capital One allows you to combine miles earned on each of their miles-earning cards as well as transfer to other cardholders with eligible miles-earning cards.\n\n#### Some customers get “special hotel offers”\nCapital One miles can be redeemed for gift cards for many popular merchants. Some cardholders with older Capital One miles-earning cards may additionally have the ability \"Get Special Hotel Offers\". If you happen to have a card with this option, you can redeem 64,250 Capital One \"miles\" for a $900 gift card with select hotel chains. See this post for more detail.\n\n### Transfer points",

It's possible to move points (Avios) between Iberia, British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Qatar. See also: Avios Sweet Spots for Award Tickets. AeroMexico ClubPremier1 to 1AeroMexico is a SkyTeam partner. Club Premier points can be used to book flights on AeroMexico, SkyTeam alliance members (such as Delta or Korean Air), or on select partner airlines. Unfortunately many have reported that awards are extremely difficult to book through AeroMexico so we do not recommend transferring points to this program. If you want to fly AeroMexico, look to transfer points to another SkyTeam partner (such as Air France) and then book AeroMexico with that program. Air Canada Aeroplan1 to 1Redeem for **Star Alliance** flights and/or flights with Air Canada partners (such as Etihad). No fuel surcharges; $39 CAD award booking fee; 5,000 points to add stopover on one-way award. See: Air Canada Aeroplan: Everything you need to know. Air France KLM Flying Blue1 to 1Monthly **Air France Promo Awards** often represent very good value. Air France miles can be used to book Sky Team awards, including Delta awards. Air France often offers very good business class award pricing between the US and Europe & Israel. ALL Accor1000 to 500Use to pay hotel bill with value of 2 Euro cents per point. In some cases (such as hotel to airline transfer bonuses) it may make sense to convert Accor points to the following airline miles at a 1 to 1 ratio: Finnair, Iberia, Qantas, or Virgin Australia Avianca LifeMiles1 to 1Avianca LifeMiles can be decent for Star Alliance awards. They offer reasonable-ish prices and **no fuel surcharges on awards**. Best of all, their mixed-cabin pricing can lead to _fantastic_ first-class award prices. See this post for details. British Airways Avios1 to 1While flights on British Airways itself often incur outrageously high fuel surcharges, many BA partners charge low or no fuel surcharges. Excellent value can often be had in redeeming BA points for short distance flights outside the US. It's possible to move points (Avios) between Iberia, British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Qatar. See also: Avios Sweet Spots for Award Tickets. Cathay Pacific Asia Miles1 to 1Cathay Pacific has a decent distance based award chart, but they don't allow stopovers longer than 24 hours. Cathay Pacific Asia Miles can be a good option for booking American Airlines flights with a distance based award chart, especially if other OneWorld Alliance miles aren't available. For long distance flights, it is possible to reduce the cost of a premium cabin award by adding on a lower cabin segment. See this post for details. Choice1 to 1Choice Privileges points seem to be randomly valuable within the US, but dependably valuable internationally in expensive locations such as Scandinavia and Japan. Points can sometimes offer great value when used towards participating Preferred Hotels of the World. Emirates Skywards1,000 to 750The best use of Emirates miles has been to fly Emirates itself. Unfortunately fuel surcharges can be extremely steep. One workaround is to book select routes such as JFK to Milan or Newark to Athens. See: How to find and book Emirates first class awards. Etihad Guest1 to 1Etihad offers a distance based award chart for flying Etihad and another for its partners. Points may offer good value for expensive but short-distance flights. EVA Air Infinity MileageLands1000 to 750If you want to fly one of the best business class products in the sky, the best way to snag EVA flights is with their own miles since they release more award space to their own members. One-way business class flights from the US to Taipei cost 75K to 80K miles. Fuel surcharges are very low on these routes.\nFinnair Plus+1 to 1Finnair points are now \"Avios\" and points can be moved to/from other Avios programs. Finnair uses zone based award charts rather than distance based. As a result, Finnair sometimes has better (and sometimes worse) pricing than other Avios programs. Iberia Avios1 to 1 via BAOn their own flights, Iberia offers low award prices and a very reasonable 25 Euro cancellation fee. Partner awards can offer good value under some circumstances as well, but these are usually nonrefundable. Fuel surcharges are sometimes lower when booking with Iberia rather than British Airways, Aer Lingus, or Qatar. It's possible to move points (Avios) between Iberia, British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Qatar. See also: Avios Sweet Spots for Award Tickets. JAL (Japan Airlines) Mileage Bank2 to 1.5JAL has a distance based partner award chart. Depending upon the length of the flights, this can lead to great award prices on partners such as Emirates and Korean Air. JetBlue1,000 to 600JetBlue points offer the most value when cheap ticket prices are available and when award taxes are high relative to the overall cost of the ticket (more details can be found here). The JetBlue Plus Card and the JetBlue Business Card offer a 10% rebate on awards, so you can get more value by holding one of these cards. Preferred Hotels & Resorts I Prefer1 to 2Redeeming points for hotel stays offers the best value but availability can be hard to find. Next best option is to look for good value points+cash opportunities. Redeeming for certificates is always poor value. Qantas Frequent Flyer1 to 1Best use is probably for flights on El Al with no fuel surcharges. Also useful for short AA flights. Qantas offers distance based award charts similar to Cathay Pacific. Both are OneWorld Alliance members. I recommend comparing award prices across both programs before transferring to either. Qantas offers round the world business class awards for only 280,000 points (but with many restrictions) Qatar Privilege Club Avios1 to 1Qatar has reasonable award prices for flying Qatar itself. Points are now transferable 1 to 1 to British Airways (and from there to Aer Lingus or Iberia). It is now also possible to book JetBlue flights with Qatar Avios. Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer1 to 1Use to book Singapore Airlines First Class awards (generally reserved for their own members), Alaska Airlines economy awards, or for Star Alliance awards (including United Airlines). TAP Air Portugal1 to 1Surcharge-free Emirates redemptions. Increased availability on TAP flights between US and Europe. Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles1 to 1Miles & Smiles offers a number of awesome sweet-spot awards including 7.5K one-way anywhere within the US, even to Hawaii. Many awards cannot be booked online but can be booked via phone or email. See: Turkish Miles & Smiles Complete Guide and Turkish business class sweet spots from the US. Virgin Atlantic Flying Club1 to 1Virgin Atlantic offers a few excellent sweet spot awards. See: Best uses for Virgin Atlantic points (Sweet Spot Spotlight). Wyndham1 to 1Wyndham often allows booking multi-room suites for the same price as a standard room. It's sometimes possible to get great value from points in that way. Bonus: award nights are not subject to resort fees. Wyndham Earner cards offer automatic 10% discount on award stays.",

Additionally, they can be redeemed for gift cards or travel booked through the Capital One travel portal or Capital One Business Travel. You'll usually get 1 cent per mile value when redeeming for gift cards or travel booked through Capital One, but you'll only get half a cent per mile in value when redeeming for cash back as a statement credit or via check. You can also use miles to pay some merchants directly (for example: Amazon.com). **Don't do this**. These options offer poor value. Further, they may compromise the security of your account (i.e. if someone hacks into your Amazon account, they might spend your Capital One \"miles\" - causing you a headache in getting your miles reinstated).\n\n## Capital One® Venture X Credit Card Manage Points\n\n### Combine Points Across Cards\n\nIf you have multiple cards that earn Capital One \"miles\", you can freely combine those miles via your online account. This can be useful when you want to put together the miles for a valuable redemption in a single account.\n\n### Share Points Across Cardholders\n\nCapital One allows cardholders to share miles with any other customer who has a credit card that earns Capital One miles. There are no annual caps or limitations. To share miles with another cardholder, you will need that person's credit card number. Simply call the number on the back of your card to initiate the transfer. Capital One miles transfer to other customers instantly.\n\n### How to Keep Points Alive\n\nThankfully, it is very easy to keep Capital One miles alive: simply keep the miles in an open Capital One miles-earning account and they will not expire. Note that if you close a Capital One miles-earning card, **you will lose any miles associated with that card**. You should either redeem your miles or move them to another card that will remain open as per the sharing section above before canceling.\n\n## Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card Lifecycle\n\n### How to meet minimum spend requirements\n\nOnce you are approved for a Capital One card, you have three months to meet the required spend in order to get the welcome bonus. If your usual spend isn’t enough, check out this resource to find many more options for increasing credit card spend.\n\n### Keep, cancel, or product change?\n\nIs this card worth keeping in the long run? If you are looking for a simple one-card solution that offers a reasonable return on everyday purchases, it might be. With a baseline redemption of 2 cents per dollar spent and the ability to also transfer to airline partners, this card offers just enough flexibility to make it worth considering as a lone card solution. However, keep in mind that there are long-term options on the market to earn 2% cash back with no annual fee and several cards that are even better in the first year. There are alternatively cards that offer bonus categories for more miles per dollar. The Venture card’s strength is in offering a combination that is less common in a single card.\n\nFor Capital One products listed on this page, some of the benefits may be provided by Visa(R) or Mastercard(R) and may vary by product. See the respective Guide to Benefits for details, as terms and exclusions apply.\n\n## Related Cards\n\n### Capital One Consumer Cards\n\nCard Offer and Details\n\nCapital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card\n\nⓘ $192 1st Yr Value EstimateClick to learn about first year value estimates",

The issuer did not provide the details, nor is it responsible for their accuracy.\n\n**Recent better offer:**Expired 3/14/22: 100K after $10K spend in the first 6 months + $200 credit for vacation rental spend in first year\n\n**FM Mini Review:**This card offers annual rebates that easily mitigate the fee for those who travel often. Authorized users are free and also get access to perks like Priority Pass, Capital One Lounges and more. The card earns 2 miles per dollar on most purchases just like the Capital One Venture Rewards card, which are worth exactly 1 cent each toward travel. This makes the return on most spend similar to a 2% cash back card (though in this case you must redeem your miles to offset travel in order to get 1 cent per mile). One huge advantage over cash back: Capital One allows transfering their miles to airline miles & hotel points. Click here for our complete card review\n\n## Capital One Venture X Review\n\nThe Capital One Venture X is a valuable all-around card. Its travel and purchase protections are excellent and it offers a decent mix of complimentary lounge access. Incredibly, up to four free authorized users receive many of the card’s best perks: lounge access, primary rental car insurance and travel/purchase protections. Over the last couple of years, Capital One miles have become a much more useful currency that can now transfer 1-1 to a good-if-not-great selection of travel partners or be redeemed for 1 cent each towards travel. The $395 annual fee is almost offset by a $300 annual travel credit for travel booked through Capital One and a 10,000 mile anniversary bonus. Combine that with the card perks and 2x everywhere earning and this card will be a keeper for many.\n\n• **Annual Fee:** $395\n\n• Authorized User Annual Fee: Free (Up to four – starting 2/1/26, you must pay $125 per authorized user for them to have lounge access)\n• **Foreign Transaction Fee:**None\n• **What points are worth:**The Capital One Venture X earns Capital One Miles. Our current Reasonable Redemption Values peg them at 1.45 cents each.\n• **Best Use for Points**: Capital One Miles can be transferred to travel partners at a 1:1 ratio, and this will usually yield the most value. Our favorite hotel transfer partner is probably Wyndham Rewards, because of the terrific redemptions that can be had with Wyndham Vacation Club and Cottages.com. Airline partners can be an excellent value as well, and include Air Canada Aeroplan, Air France/KLM Flying Blue, and British Airways Avios. Venture X cardholders can also redeem miles to erase travel purchases or redeem miles directly through the Capital One Travel Portal at 1 cent per point.\n• **Earning Categories:**",

However, combined with the 10,000 anniversary miles, this card more or less pays for itself. Given that, I think it will be an easy keeper for many as a 2x-everywhere backstop with lounge/travel benefits.\n\n## Capital One Venture X Pros and Cons\n\n### Pros\n\n• 2x everywhere\n• Free authorized users get an impressive suite of benefits (until 2/1/26 only)\n• Card effectively pays for itself with anniversary miles and annual travel credit\n• Excellent travel protections, including primary rental car insurance\n• $300 travel credit applies to cars, hotels, and flights booked through Capital One Travel\n• Nice variety of transfer partners\n• Good mix of lounge partners\n• Points can be redeemed at 1 cent each for travel if you don’t want to hassle with transferring partners (although, as a rule, we don’t recommend doing it)\n\n### Cons",

    "content": "### Cons\n\n• Outside of Capital One Travel, no bonus categories\n• High annual fee ($395)\n• Annual travel credit has to be used through Capital One Travel, oftentimes with higher pricing (or possible headaches when dealing with problems)\n• It can be difficult to get approvals for multiple Capital One cards\n• Transfers to Choice Privileges at 1/2 the rate of Citi\n• Some folks won’t like the lack of domestic airline transfer partners\n\n## Capital One Transfer Partners\n\nRewards Program\n\nCapital One Transfer Ratio\n\nBest Uses\n\nRewards Program\n\nCapital One Transfer Ratio\n\nBest Uses\n\nAer Lingus Avios1 to 1 via BAFuel surcharges are sometimes lower when booking with Aer Lingus rather than British Airways, Qatar, or Iberia. It's possible to move points (Avios) between Iberia, British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Qatar. See also: Avios Sweet Spots for Award Tickets. AeroMexico ClubPremier1 to 1AeroMexico is a SkyTeam partner. Club Premier points can be used to book flights on AeroMexico, SkyTeam alliance members (such as Delta or Korean Air), or on select partner airlines. Unfortunately many have reported that awards are extremely difficult to book through AeroMexico so we do not recommend transferring points to this program. If you want to fly AeroMexico, look to transfer points to another SkyTeam partner (such as Air France) and then book AeroMexico with that program. Air Canada Aeroplan1 to 1Redeem for **Star Alliance** flights and/or flights with Air Canada partners (such as Etihad). No fuel surcharges; $39 CAD award booking fee; 5,000 points to add stopover on one-way award. See: Air Canada Aeroplan: Everything you need to know. Air France KLM Flying Blue1 to 1Monthly **Air France Promo Awards** often represent very good value. Air France miles can be used to book Sky Team awards, including Delta awards. Air France often offers very good business class award pricing between the US and Europe & Israel. ALL Accor1000 to 500Use to pay hotel bill with value of 2 Euro cents per point. In some cases (such as hotel to airline transfer bonuses) it may make sense to convert Accor points to the following airline miles at a 1 to 1 ratio: Finnair, Iberia, Qantas, or Virgin Australia Avianca LifeMiles1 to 1Avianca LifeMiles can be decent for Star Alliance awards. They offer reasonable-ish prices and **no fuel surcharges on awards**. Best of all, their mixed-cabin pricing can lead to _fantastic_ first-class award prices. See this post for details. British Airways Avios1 to 1While flights on British Airways itself often incur outrageously high fuel surcharges, many BA partners charge low or no fuel surcharges. Excellent value can often be had in redeeming BA points for short distance flights outside the US. It's possible to move points (Avios) between Iberia, British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Qatar. See also: Avios Sweet Spots for Award Tickets. Cathay Pacific Asia Miles1 to 1Cathay Pacific has a decent distance based award chart, but they don't allow stopovers longer than 24 hours. Cathay Pacific Asia Miles can be a good option for booking American Airlines flights with a distance based award chart, especially if other OneWorld Alliance miles aren't available. For long distance flights, it is possible to reduce the cost of a premium cabin award by adding on a lower cabin segment. See this post for details. Choice1 to 1Choice Privileges points seem to be randomly valuable within the US, but dependably valuable internationally in expensive locations such as Scandinavia and Japan. Points can sometimes offer great value when used towards participating Preferred Hotels of the World. Emirates Skywards1,000 to 750The best use of Emirates miles has been to fly Emirates itself. Unfortunately fuel surcharges can be extremely steep. One workaround is to book select routes such as JFK to Milan or Newark to Athens. See: How to find and book Emirates first class awards. Etihad Guest1 to 1Etihad offers a distance based award chart for flying Etihad and another for its partners. Points may offer good value for expensive but short-distance flights. EVA Air Infinity MileageLands1000 to 750If you want to fly one of the best business class products in the sky, the best way to snag EVA flights is with their own miles since they release more award space to their own members. One-way business class flights from the US to Taipei cost 75K to 80K miles. Fuel surcharges are very low on these routes.\nFinnair Plus+1 to 1Finnair points are now \"Avios\" and points can be moved to/from other Avios programs. Finnair uses zone based award charts rather than distance based. As a result, Finnair sometimes has better (and sometimes worse) pricing than other Avios programs. Iberia Avios1 to 1 via BAOn their own flights, Iberia offers low award prices and a very reasonable 25 Euro cancellation fee. Partner awards can offer good value under some circumstances as well, but these are usually nonrefundable. Fuel surcharges are sometimes lower when booking with Iberia rather than British Airways, Aer Lingus, or Qatar. It's possible to move points (Avios) between Iberia, British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Qatar. See also: Avios Sweet Spots for Award Tickets. JAL (Japan Airlines) Mileage Bank2 to 1.5JAL has a distance based partner award chart. Depending upon the length of the flights, this can lead to great award prices on partners such as Emirates and Korean Air. JetBlue1,000 to 600JetBlue points offer the most value when cheap ticket prices are available and when award taxes are high relative to the overall cost of the ticket (more details can be found here). The JetBlue Plus Card and the JetBlue Business Card offer a 10% rebate on awards, so you can get more value by holding one of these cards. Preferred Hotels & Resorts I Prefer1 to 2Redeeming points for hotel stays offers the best value but availability can be hard to find. Next best option is to look for good value points+cash opportunities. Redeeming for certificates is always poor value. Qantas Frequent Flyer1 to 1Best use is probably for flights on El Al with no fuel surcharges. Also useful for short AA flights. Qantas offers distance based award charts similar to Cathay Pacific. Both are OneWorld Alliance members. I recommend comparing award prices across both programs before transferring to either. Qantas offers round the world business class awards for only 280,000 points (but with many restrictions) Qatar Privilege Club Avios1 to 1Qatar has reasonable award prices for flying Qatar itself. Points are now transferable 1 to 1 to British Airways (and from there to Aer Lingus or Iberia). It is now also possible to book JetBlue flights with Qatar Avios. Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer1 to 1Use to book Singapore Airlines First Class awards (generally reserved for their own members), Alaska Airlines economy awards, or for Star Alliance awards (including United Airlines). TAP Air Portugal1 to 1Surcharge-free Emirates redemptions. Increased availability on TAP flights between US and Europe. Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles1 to 1Miles & Smiles offers a number of awesome sweet-spot awards including 7.5K one-way anywhere within the US, even to Hawaii. Many awards cannot be booked online but can be booked via phone or email. See: Turkish Miles & Smiles Complete Guide and Turkish business class sweet spots from the US. Virgin Atlantic Flying Club1 to 1Virgin Atlantic offers a few excellent sweet spot awards. See: Best uses for Virgin Atlantic points (Sweet Spot Spotlight). Wyndham1 to 1Wyndham often allows booking multi-room suites for the same price as a standard room. It's sometimes possible to get great value from points in that way. Bonus: award nights are not subject to resort fees. Wyndham Earner cards offer automatic 10% discount on award stays.",

The card earns 2 miles per dollar on most purchases just like the Capital One Venture X Rewards card, which are worth exactly 1 cent each toward travel. This makes the return on most spend similar to a 2% cash back card (though in this case you must redeem your miles to offset travel in order to get 1 cent per mile).

    "content": "• Featured Article\n• Lounges\n\n**Update 2/1/26:** A quick reminder that the lounge policy for Venture X and Venture X Business cardholders will be changing with effect from February 1, 2026.\n\n~\n\nSince their launches, the Venture X and Venture X Business cards have been popular cards for those seeking lounge access. That’s because Capital One implemented a generous policy for bringing guests into lounges, plus additional cardholders (AKA authorized users) on personal Venture X cards received complimentary lounge access despite the authorized user cards not coming with an added fee.\n\nThat’s sadly changing.\n\nAs of February 1, 2026, only primary cardholders will get complimentary lounge access. Not only will additional cardholders have to pay a special lounge access fee of $125 in order to gain access, but primary cardholders will also have to pay a fee to have guests join them if they have a personal Venture X card, as will guests of Venture X Business cardholders depending on the type of lounge.\nCapital One Lounge DFW\n\nIn this article: Toggle\n\n## **Additional Cardholder Changes**\n\nFrom February 1, 2026, additional cardholders on Capital One Venture X cards will lose lounge access. To regain access, you’ll have to pay an annual lounge access fee of $125. That will reenable access to Capital One Lounges, Capital One Landings and Priority Pass lounges. Venture X Business additional cardholders didn’t previously benefit from complimentary lounge access, but they’ll now have the option to also pay a $125 lounge access fee.\n\nSomething important to note is that there still won’t be a fee to get additional cardholder cards on your Venture X and/or Venture X Business cards. It’s only if those additional cardholders wish to have lounge access that a $125 fee will be payable.\n\nFor both personal Venture X cardholders and Venture X Business cardholders, there’ll be a limit of four additional cardholders for whom you can pay $125 to gain lounge access.\n\n## **Guest Access Changes**\n\nAlso starting from February 1, 2026, primary cardholders will no longer be able to provide complimentary lounge access to traveling companions if they have the personal Venture X card; Venture X Business cardholders on the other hand will have a better policy.\n\nHere’s what the new policies will be based on the lounge types and which version of the Venture X card you have:\n\n#### **Priority Pass**\n\n• **Venture X** – Primary cardholders & additional cardholders who have paid the $125 lounge access fee will be able to bring guests for $35 per visit.\n• **Venture X Business** – Primary cardholders & additional cardholders who have paid the $125 lounge access fee will be able to provide complimentary access for up to two guests. Additional guests can be brought along for $35 per person.\n\n#### **Capital One Lounges & Landings**",

    "content": "#### **Capital One Lounges & Landings**\n\n• **Venture X** – Primary cardholders won’t be able to provide complimentary access to guests automatically. However, if you and eligible additional cardholders spend $75,000 in a calendar year, you’ll be able to bring two complimentary guests in to Capital One Lounges and one complimentary guest to Capital One Landings. This access is valid for the rest of the year in which $75,000 is spent and all of the following year.\nPrimary cardholders & additional cardholders who have paid the $125 lounge access fee will be able to pay $45 per guest per visit who’s 18+; children ages 2-17 will be charged a discounted fee of $25, while children under two years old will be free.\n• **Venture X Business** – Primary cardholders won’t be able to provide complimentary access to guests automatically. However, if you spend $75,000 across all cardholders in a calendar year, you’ll be able to bring two complimentary guests in to Capital One Lounges and one complimentary guest to Capital One Landings. This access is valid for the rest of the year in which $75,000 is spent and all of the following year.\nPrimary cardholders & additional cardholders who have paid the $125 lounge access fee will be able to pay $45 per guest per visit who’s 18+; children ages 2-17 will be charged a discounted fee of $25, while children under two years old will be free.\nRose Business Lounge at Ho Chi Minh airport – part of Priority Pass\n## **Quick Thoughts**\n\nConsidering how overcrowded airport lounges have gotten in recent years and how generous the Venture X and Venture X Business lounge policies – particularly for additional cardholders on personal cards – were, it’s not surprising that some kind of restrictions would eventually be implemented. However, that doesn’t take away from the fact that this is potentially a massive hit for Venture X and Venture X Business cardholders.\n\nWe added a couple of friends to my wife’s Venture X card a few months ago so that they’d be able to get complimentary lounge access, so it’s a shame that from February 1, 2026 they’ll each have to pay $125 if they want to maintain that.\n\nFor infrequent travelers, having complimentary lounge access was nice to have. If you’re only flying a handful of times per year though, it might not seem worth paying the $125 fee, particularly if the airports you fly in and out of only have access to Priority Pass lounges that happen to be mediocre.\n\nIt’s even worse for personal Venture X primary and additional cardholders who want to bring along guests. That’s because it’ll now cost $35 per guest for Priority Pass lounges. Venture X Business cardholders can breath a sigh of relief as they’ll still be able to bring two complimentary guests into Priority Pass lounges, for now at least.\n\nDespite these changes, for many cardholders it’ll still be a no brainer to pay the $395 annual fee on these cards seeing as you get a $300 annual credit for bookings made through Capital One’s travel booking site or Capital One Business Travel, as well as 10,000 bonus miles at renewal. However, if you find it to be a hassle to redeem that $300 credit, having Capital One greatly restrict lounge access for additional cardholders and guests might make the decision on keeping the card more of a toss up.\n\n## **Question**\n\nWill these lounge access changes have an effect on your decision to renew your Venture X and/or Venture X Business card? Let us know in the comments below.\n\n## **Question**\n\nWill these lounge access changes have an effect on your decision to renew your Venture X and/or Venture X Business card?

    "title": "Frequent Miler - (Sold out) World Cup tickets for Capital One Venture X cardholders on sale at noon Eastern - Chunk 1",
    "content": "• Activities\n\n**Update 12:10 Eastern:**Tickets are now sold out.\n\nStarting today at 12:00 Eastern, Capital One Venture X cardmembers will have the opportunity to buy FIFA World Cup 2026 tickets for matches in U.S. host cities. This is not a lottery; it will be an opportunity to purchase tickets for these matches, likely at market price. Only the top two pricing levels will be available for each match.\n\nChase did the same sale two days ago, and tickets were sold out within 20-30 minutes. If you want to get in on this one, be at your computer at noon sharp.\n\nNote that this offer is for personal Venture X cardholders only; Venture X Business cardholders are excluded.\n\n## The Deal\n\n• From February 12-24, 2026 (or while supplies last), Capital One Venture X cardholders will have an opportunity to buy FIFA World Cup 2026 tickets.\n\n• Expect almost all tickets to be sold out within an hour.\n\n**Direct link to Deal**\n\n## Key Terms\n\n• The Venture X Cardholder Offer is not available to all cardholders. To access the ticket sale, you must:\n\n• Have an eligible Venture X Visa card and enter the 16-digit number on your card to access the chance to purchase tickets (access to the sale with a Virtual Card Number is not available)\n• Be a Venture X primary account holder, account manager, or authorized user in good standing, meaning your account must not be currently, or become delinquent, closed, restricted, or otherwise not in good standing during the offer period.\n• Not upgrade, downgrade or change your Venture X account to another credit card product during the offer or fulfillment period.\n• Register for FIFA ID on the FIFA ticketing site.\n\n• Eligibility for the Venture X Cardholder Offer is determined at the sole discretion of Capital One.\n• New Venture X card applicants are not eligible if their new card is received after tickets have sold out.\n• When purchasing, make sure the following information is accurate: eligible credit card number, security code, billing address associated with the card, name as it appears on the card, and expiration date.\n• **Venture X Business cardholders are not eligible for this offer.**\n• The Venture X Cardholder Offer on FIFA ticketing site opens on February 12, 2026, 12:00 p.m. ET and closes on February 24, 2026, 11:59 p.m. ET, or until available tickets are sold out, whichever comes first.\n• Tickets will be available for purchase on a first-come, first- served basis and are not guaranteed.\n• Tickets are limited to 4 per cardholder.\n\n## Quick Thoughts\n\nThis looks similar to the sale FIFA ran for Chase cardholders a couple of days ago, but it’s only open to those who hold one Capital One card: the Venture X. In contrast, Chase’s sale was open to cardholders of multiple Chase products. In addition, Chase allowed each household to purchase up to forty tickets, while Capital One is limiting its cardholders to four tickets each. Hopefully, those stricter limits will make it easier for more people to actually score tickets.\n\nThis sale also seems more streamlined than Chase’s, which required you to click the “Access Tickets” button shown above, then wait for a unique ticket link that took you to FIFA’s website to sign in and view tickets. Each step in that process was overwhelmed with traffic and would error-out, making it extremely cumbersome to work through.\n\nIt looks like Capital One is taking you directly to a special platform to purchase tickets. If there is indeed only one step, it should be easier to get from verification to viewing inventory. Make sure that you register for a FIFA ID before the sale, and have your username and password ready. It will almost certainly slow you down significantly if you wait to sign up until the sale goes live.\n\n**** **Want to learn more about miles and points?** Subscribe to email updates or check out our podcast on your favorite podcast platform.",

The card earns 2 miles per dollar on most purchases just like the Capital One Venture Rewards card, which are worth exactly 1 cent each toward travel. This makes the return on most spend similar to a 2% cash back card (though in this case you must redeem your miles to offset travel in order to get 1 cent per mile). One huge advantage over cash back: Capital One allows transfering their miles to airline miles & hotel points.

This card has no foreign currency conversion fees.\n\n**Noteworthy perks:**$300 annual credit for bookings made through Capital One Travel ✦ 10,000 bonus miles each year starting at first anniversary ✦ Up to $120 application fee credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck® ✦ Access to Capital One Lounge and Landing locations ✦ Priority Pass membership (participating lounges only) after enrollment ✦ Cell phone insurance ✦ Trip insurance ✦ Primary CDW coverage ✦ Redeem miles for travel at value of 1 cent per mile ✦ Convert miles to airline miles & hotel points\n\n## Quick Thoughts\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card can make for a unique one-card solution in that it offers the best of both worlds: earn 2x “miles” on all purchases and then redeem those “miles” for paid travel at a reasonable rate of return _or_ transfer those “miles” to airline partners. There’s also an enviable list of travel perks that makes the card a “keeper” in our opinion.",

    "title": "Frequent Miler - (Ending soon) Capital One Venture X Card Welcome Offer: 100,000 miles after $10k in spend - Chunk 2",
    "content": "Our Reasonable Redemption Values peg C1 miles at 1.45 cents each (meaning that we expect most folks to be able to get 1.45 cents of value per point without having to cherry-pick awards). That makes this offer worth ~$1,450.\n\nThat would be a great deal on its own, but the problem is that $10,000 minimum spend, the highest that I remember ever seeing on the Venture X. Effectively, the extra 25,000 miles on the increased offer requires an additional $6K in spend. Indeed, many folks would probably prefer the previous version with the lower minimum, so that they could put the additional $6,000 towards another welcome offer.\n\nAs always, it’s worth noting that you do earn 2x on all of that $10,000 in spend, so you’d actually end up with 120,000 miles, or 12x per dollar. That’s better than a kick in the pants, for sure.\n\nHowever, for comparison’s sake, you can also get:\n\n• 125,000 Ultimate Rewards points after $6K spend with the Chase Sapphire Reserve®\n• Up to 175,000 Membership Rewards points after $8k spend with the American Express Platinum Card®\n• 100,000 Citi ThankYou Points after $6k in spend with the Citi Strata Elite card\n\nThose are all very different products, all of which have higher annual fees than the Venture, and none of which offer 2x everywhere earning. However, before jumping into the Venture X, it’s worth doing some comparison shopping to make sure that it’s the best option for you.\n\n## Capital One Application Tips\n\n• **48-month Rule:**Existing or previous cardholders are not eligible for the same **personal** card if they have received a new cardmember bonus for the same product within the last 48 months. This doesn't apply to business cards.\n• **Venture \"Family\" Rule:**Capital One now applies additional \"family\" rules to the personal Venture cards.\n\n• **VentureOne**: You are not eligible for a welcome offer on the VentureOne card if you've received a welcome bonus on any other personal Venture card within the last 48 months.\n• **Venture Rewards**: You are not eligible for a welcome offer on the Venture Rewards card if you've received a welcome bonus on a Venture X or Venture Rewards card within the last 48 months.\n• **Venture X**: You are not eligible for a welcome offer on the Venture X card if you've received a welcome bonus on another Venture X card within the last 48 months.\n• ****2 card limit no more?****Conventional wisdom and user experience used to be that you can have at most 2 Capital One cards. However, there are now frequent data points of some people having many more.\n• **1 Charge Card Limit:** Capital One only allows cardholders to be have one business charge card, so it's not possible to be the primary cardholders on both the Venture X Business and Spark Cash Plus. This doesn't apply to authorized users.\n• **Hard inquiries** often get issued through _all_ _3 credit bureaus._\n• **Velocity Limits?** It used to be thought that Capital One will only approve you for one card every six months. While this is still many people's experience, we've now frequently seen data points of approvals for a second card within that timeframe.\n• **Application Status**: Call (800) 903-9177 to check your application status.\n• **Reconsideration**: If denied, call (800) 625-7866 for reconsideration.\n\nFor Capital One products listed on this page, some of the above benefits are provided by Visa® or Mastercard® and may vary by product.
