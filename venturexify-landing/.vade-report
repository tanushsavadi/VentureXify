# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js 14.2+ App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Package
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` using npm
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` with the new dependency

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/app/layout.tsx**
  - Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';`
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, right after `<Analytics />`

## Implementation Details
- Used the Next.js 13.5+ App Router approach with '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
- Placed the SpeedInsights component in the root layout alongside the existing Analytics component
- This ensures Speed Insights will track all pages in the application automatically

## Testing Performed
✅ ESLint check passed with no warnings or errors
✅ Build completed successfully (`npm run build`)
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ All static pages generated correctly

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
2. `package-lock.json` - Updated lock file with new dependency tree
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights component

## Notes
- The implementation follows Vercel's recommended approach for Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Speed Insights will automatically track Core Web Vitals and performance metrics
- No additional configuration is required; the component works out of the box
- The project already had Vercel Analytics installed, so Speed Insights complements it nicely
